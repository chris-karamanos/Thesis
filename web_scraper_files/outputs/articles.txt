Trump calls on House Republicans to vote to release Epstein files
US President Donald Trump has urged lawmakers in his own party to vote to release files relating to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
Trump wrote on Sunday night that Republicans in the House of Representatives should do so "because we have nothing to hide".
It is a striking reversal for Trump after weeks of saying the clamour for a vote on the release was a Democratic-driven distraction.
There has been a slow drip feed of documents concerning the disgraced financier by House Democrats, some of which reference Trump, who has always denied any link to Epstein's sex abuse and trafficking.
But details of his and other prominent figures' past relationship with Epstein have fuelled speculation and led to a public spat with one of Trump's staunchest supporters.
Potentially dozens of Republicans have now signalled they are willing to break ranks and vote in favour of a bill that would compel the US government to publish all its documents on Epstein.
Supporters of the bill appear to have enough votes for it to pass the House this week, though it is unclear whether it would pass in the Senate, the other chamber of the US Congress.
Epstein, a financier, was found dead in his New York prison cell in 2019, in what a coroner later ruled a suicide. He was being held on charges of sex trafficking, having previously been convicted of soliciting prostitution from a minor in 2008.
The two criminal investigations into Epstein amassed a vast trove of documents including transcripts of interviews with victims and witnesses, and items confiscated from raids of his various properties. The material that has not yet been made public is often referred to as the Epstein files.
Since returning to the White House, Trump has dismissed the need to release more documents, despite this being a key demand of many of his supporters and some of his key allies.
He recently called it a Democrat-led "hoax" to "deflect" attention away from his party's work.
"I DON'T CARE!," he wrote on his Truth social platform, urging Republicans to "get BACK ON POINT".
Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson made a similar point on Sunday, saying calls to release the files were the "entire game plan" for opposition Democrats.
Trump was historically photographed at social gatherings with Epstein, but has repeatedly said he severed contact with the financier years before Epstein's 2008 conviction, and was unaware of his criminal activity.
The US president's change of position on the matter comes after Democrats on the House Oversight Committee published three email exchanges.
They included correspondence between Epstein and his long-time associate Ghislaine Maxwell, who is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence for sex trafficking.
Some of those exchanges make references to Trump. In one email, sent in 2011, Epstein writes to Maxwell: "I want you to realize that that dog that hasn't barked is Trump.. [VICTIM] spent hours at my house with him."
The White House said on Wednesday that the victim referenced in the email was prominent Epstein accuser Virginia Giuffre.
Giuffre, who died in April, has said that she never saw Trump participate in any abuse and there is no implication of any wrongdoing by Trump in the emails.
Hours after the release, House Republicans published a far larger tranche of 20,000 files to counter what they said was a Democratic effort to "cherry-pick" documents in an attempt to "create a fake narrative to slander" Trump.
Speaking to the BBC on Monday, Glenn Grothman, a Republican congressman on the House Oversight Committee, attempted to explain Trump's change of mind.
He suggested the president felt that an ongoing "systematic release of files" by the committee would only fuel further speculation and distract from other topics such as Trump's budgetary plans. Trump viewed it as easier to simply "let the press go nuts for a couple of days" over the files, Grothman suggested.
Both Democrats and some Republicans have been backing legislation to release all the documents. Republican Representative Thomas Massie, a co-sponsor of the bill, telling ABC News on Sunday that as many as 100 Republicans could vote in favour.
Known as the Epstein Files Transparency Act, the bill aims to force the justice department to release all unclassified records, documents, communications and investigative materials linked to the paedophile.
Trump would also have to sign off on the release of the documents if it passes both legislative chambers.
In a letter addressed to Congress, Epstein survivors and Giuffre's family called for US lawmakers to vote in favour of releasing the files.
"Remember that your primary duty is to your constituents. Look into the eyes of your children, your sisters, your mothers, and your aunts," the letter reads.
"Imagine if they had been preyed upon. Imagine if you yourself were a survivor. What would you want for them? What would you want for yourself? When you vote, we will remember your decision at the ballot box."
Trump's handling of the issue has led in recent days to a public feud with Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, traditionally one of his fiercest proponents.
The US president attacked her on Friday, calling her "wacky" and a "traitor", and suggesting that she should be unseated in next year's elections.
Greene in turn questioned whether Trump was still putting "America First" and said he was "making an example" of her to scare other Republicans away from voting in favour of the bill.
Meanwhile, the US Department of Justice has confirmed it will investigate Epstein's alleged links to major banks and several prominent Democrats, including former President Clinton. Clinton has strongly denied he had any knowledge of Epstein's crimes.
The names of Hoffman, the founder of LinkedIn and a prominent Democratic donor, and Summers, Clinton's treasury secretary, both appeared in the most recent release.
Summers has previously expressed regret over being in contact with Epstein following his conviction, while Hoffman has said the extent of his involvement with the broker was to fundraise for the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

Australia revokes visa of South African seen at neo-Nazi rally
A South African man who was seen attending a neo-Nazi rally outside an Australian state parliament has had his visa revoked.
Matthew Gruter, who has been in Australia since 2022, took part in an anti-Jewish protest outside the New South Wales parliament organised by the National Socialist Network earlier this month.
He was seen among around 60 men clad in black, who held up a banner that said "Abolish the Jewish lobby", Australian media report.
Australia has seen a recent rise in right-wing extremism. Its government made the Nazi salute punishable by a mandatory prison term earlier this year.
Australia's Home Affairs Minister, Tony Burke, confirmed the cancellation of Mr Gruter's visa, saying: "If you are on a visa, you are a guest.
"If you're a citizen, you're a full member of the Australian family. Like with any household, if a guest turns up to show hatred and wreck the household, they can be told it's time to go home."
Mr Gruter moved to Australia with his wife and works as a civil engineer, according to ABC News.
The National Socialist Network, which organised the rally on 8 November, is a well-known neo-Nazi group in Australia. Mr Gruter is a senior member of the group in New South Wales, the Sydney Morning Herald reports.
Demonstrators repeatedly chanted "blood and honour", a slogan associated with the Hitler Youth, according to ABC News.
New South Wales Premier Chris Minns described the rally, which lasted about 20 minutes, as a "shocking display of hatred and racism and antisemitism".
Sarah Schwartz, executive officer of the Jewish Council of Australia, told ABC News neo-Nazi groups were a threat to multiculturalism in the country and there needed to be a distinction between peaceful protests and "hateful stunts".
"They're acts of hate speech, and they should be considered as such," she added.

Teacher killed and 25 girls abducted in gunbattle at Nigerian school
Armed men have killed a teacher and abducted at least 25 students in an attack on a girls' secondary school in north-western Nigeria, police say.
The gang invaded the Government Girls Comprehensive Secondary School in Maga, Kebbi State, at around 04:00 local time (0300 GMT) on Monday, they said.
The attackers "engaged police personnel on duty in a gun duel" before scaling the perimeter fence and seizing the students from their hostel, a statement said.
One member of staff was killed while trying to protect the students. A second sustained gunshot wounds and is now receiving treatment.
Eyewitnesses described a large group of attackers, known locally as bandits, who arrived firing sporadically to cause panic.
Residents told the BBC that the gunmen subsequently marched a number of girls into nearby bushland.
The police said they had deployed "additional police tactical units, alongside military personnel and vigilante groups" to the area.
A coordinated search and rescue operation is underway in surrounding forests and suspected escape routes.
Over the past decade, schools in northern Nigeria have become frequent targets for armed groups, who often carry out abductions to seek ransom payments or leverage deals with the government.
As well as trying to crack down on the kidnappers, Nigeria has also banned the payment of ransoms in an attempt to make it less lucrative.
This is the first major school abduction since March 2024, when more than 200 pupils were seized from a school in Kuriga, Kaduna state.
The attack in Kebbi State highlights the persistent security crisis plaguing the region, leaving families in Maga in a state of fearful exhaustion as they wait and hope for their daughters' safe return.

Louvre closes gallery due to structural issue
The Louvre museum in Paris has announced it is closing one of its galleries because of structural weaknesses.
The Campana Gallery - consisting of nine rooms which host Greek ceramics - will remain shut as engineers investigate "certain beams supporting the floors", the Louvre said.
The announcement adds to the museum's unwelcome attention following a high-profile heist last month in which jewels worth €88m (£76m; $102m) were taken.
Criticism has focused on lax security at the world's most-visited museum in the French capital.
Four people have been arrested over the heist, but the jewels have not been recovered.
In a statement on Monday, the Louvre said that structural issues in offices on the second floor - above the Campana Gallery in the Sully wing of the museum - had led to its decision.
"During these investigations, the Campana Gallery... will be closed to the public as a precautionary measure," it said.
Three weeks after the jewel theft, a report was released in which the Court of Auditors criticised managers who had preferred to invest in new artworks and exhibitions rather than basic upkeep and protection of the museum.
Basing its findings on the years 2018-24, the report found the museum had spent €105.4m (£92.7m) on buying new artworks and €63.5m on exhibition spaces.
But at the same time it spent only €26.7m on maintenance works, and €59.5m on restoration of the palace building.
On the day of the heist, the suspects arrived at 09:30 (07:30 GMT), just after the museum opened to visitors.
The suspects arrived with a stolen vehicle-mounted mechanical lift to gain access to the Galerie d'Apollon (Gallery of Apollo) via a balcony close to the River Seine. The men used a disc cutter to crack open display cases housing the jewellery.
Prosecutors said the thieves were inside for four minutes and made their escape on two scooters waiting outside at 09:38, before switching to cars.
One of the stolen items - a crown - was dropped during the escape. The other seven jewels have not been found.
The fear is that they have already been spirited abroad, though the prosecutor in charge of the case has said she is still hopeful they can be retrieved intact.
Those arrested over the heist that shocked France were all petty criminals rather than organised crime professionals, Paris's prosecutor has said.
Since the incident, security measures have been tightened around France's cultural institutions.
The Louvre has even transferred some of its most precious jewels to the Bank of France.

France investigating Vinted over alleged links to pornographic content
Second-hand clothing platform Vinted is under investigation in France after some user accounts were found to be directing visitors to pornographic content.
France's Children's Rights Commissioner Sarah El-Haïry said she had asked watchdog Arcom to examine the allegations first reported in French media.
Vinted, which has 23 million users in France, has no age-verification procedure - meaning children and teenagers could have been exposed to pornographic material without having to show proof they were over 18.
In a statement, the Lithuania-based company said it had a "zero-tolerance policy regarding unsolicited communications of a sexual nature or the promotion of sexual services".
"All inappropriate and illegal content is removed, and where necessary we take measures against users, including blocking them definitively from our site," it said.
Vinted is taking the situation "very seriously", it added.
Reports first surfaced after some sellers showing photographs of swimwear or lingerie were found to be luring viewers to their personal pages on adult platforms such as OnlyFans.
"Predators have been using the sale of ordinary items of clothing to direct people to porn sites," El-Haïry said.
France has recently issued warnings to other global e-commerce platforms, including Shein - headquartered in Singapore - after products including childlike sex dolls appeared in their marketing listings.
French officials say the case against Shein forms part of a wider investigation into other major e-commerce platforms accused of allowing illicit products to be sold online.
Paris prosecutors are examining whether Shein, AliExpress, Temu and Wish breached laws relating to violent, pornographic or "undignified" content accessible to minors.
Shein and AliExpress are also being investigated specifically over the alleged dissemination of child-related pornographic material. The cases have been referred to the Paris Office des Mineurs, which handles offences involving the protection of children.
Shein has already banned the sale of all sex dolls on its platform worldwide and says it is permanently blocking seller accounts linked to the items.
The French consumer watchdog, the Directorate General for Competition, Consumer Affairs and Fraud Control, said descriptions of the dolls left "little doubt as to their child-pornography nature".

--- Full Text ---
After returning to action earlier this month following his recovery from thumb and knee injuries, Philadelphia 76ers guard Jared McCain hasn't really looked like himself, so the team is giving him time to return to his usual form.
Adam Aaronson of the Philly Voice reported that McCain has been assigned to the Sixers' G League affiliate, the Delaware Blue Coats, and he will play in their games on Thursday night and Saturday so he can "get minutes and continue acclimating." Aaronson added that McCain has "acknowledged the difficulties of playing with his bulky left knee brace," and while he'll still be on a minutes restriction, he'll have "longer stints" on the court.
McCain had his promising rookie season cut short by a torn meniscus after just 23 games. He averaged 15.3 points and showed flashes of immense potential, earning Eastern Conference Rookie of the Month honors in November. While he was expected to be a key contributor for Philadelphia this season, he was sidelined for the start of the year after undergoing surgery to repair a UCL tear in his right thumb.
McCain returned to action on Nov. 4 and played 15 minutes in a 113-111 loss to the Cleveland Cavaliers. He's played two more times since then, but he didn't score a single point in any of his appearances, missing all nine of his field goal attempts.
The Sixers are off to a 7-4 start due in large part to the scorching performances by star point guard Tyrese Maxey. The 25-year-old is averaging career highs of 32.1 points, 4.9 rebounds and 8.3 assists, and it appears that he's taken over as the face of the team over former MVP center Joel Embiid, who's played six games this year.
If McCain can return to his old self, he would add even more depth to a Philadelphia backcourt rotation that also includes rookie guard VJ Edgecombe and veteran wings Quentin Grimes and Kelly Oubre Jr.
The Sixers will return to action on Friday in a tough test against the Detroit Pistons (10-2).

The New Orleans Pelicans are a 2-10 basketball team, ranked last in the Western Conference, with no signs of digging their way out of the cellar anytime soon. The abysmal start to the 2025-26 season understandably led some to question whether Zion Williamson should be traded.
An NBA executive told Brian Windhorst, "To be honest, their move might be a win-now trade, not a Zion trade. His trade value isn't there and they are facing some pressure to win."
The problem is that there is no evidence that Williamson's value will actually go up.
The Pelicans are 109-110 with him in the lineup and 0-5 this season when he starts. He is a ball-dominant forward who is a subpar defender and has never evolved his game to include perimeter shooting, which has become such an important element of today's game.
That he has not proven an ability to stay healthy and has had questions about his conditioning at different points only enhances the idea that Williamson's value is, arguably, as high as it is going to get.
He is averaging 22.8 points, 6.8 rebounds, and 4.6 assists in his five appearances this season but again, has been hampered by an injury that has cost him time.
This is despite telling reporters entering the season that he was in the best shape of his career.
Those numbers and his raw, physical gifts may appeal to front offices looking for one more piece to put their team in playoff or NBA title contention.
It would be irresponsible for the Pelicans front office not to take what they can get for him now, look to the future, and consider another rebuild focused on Derik Queen and Trey Murphy II.
Otherwise, New Orleans could be stuck waiting for increased trade value that has not and may never materialized.
Especially with another hamstring injury that has caused him to miss time.

Dallas Mavericks star Anthony Davis will be on the shelf a little longer.
Davis will miss at least seven-to-10 more days while rehabbing from a calf injury, the team announced Sunday, according to NBA insider Marc Stein.
Davis has been sidelined since leaving the first quarter of an Oct. 29 matchup with the Indiana Pacers with what the team described at the time as left lower leg soreness.
An MRI later later revealed "low grade left calf strain," the Mavs announced on Oct. 31. Head coach Jason Kidd described the injury at the time as a "day-to-day" issue.
Davis was sidelined for at least part of the offseason after undergoing eye surgery, which Kidd previously said had impacted his conditioning.
Although he was still averaging 25 points and 11.8 rebounds through his first four games, Davis may need some time to ramp up once he returns.
Davis' absence has raised concerns for the Mavs given his injury history, which limited him to 51 total games in a 2024-25 season split between the Los Angeles Lakers and Mavericks.
His latest injury has put even more pressure on rookie Cooper Flagg, especially as Kyrie Irving remains sidelined while recovering from the torn ACL in his left knee he suffered last March.
While Kidd experimented with playing Flagg at point guard, the Mavs got off to a 3-8 start to season that led to the dismissal of former general manager Nico Harrison.
The Mavs will look to take some of the pressure off Flagg and start turning the season around by getting Davis back to game speed as soon as possible.

The New Orleans Pelicans are still early on in their coaching search, but a handful of notable names have already been linked to the team.
Per NBA insider Marc Stein , current Milwaukee Bucks assistant coach and former Los Angeles Lakers head coach Darvin Ham "is a name to watch" in the search.
The Pelicans fired head coach Willie Green on Saturday after a rough 2-10 start to the season. Green had been New Orleans' coach since 2021, leading the team to two playoff appearances but losing in the first round twice. The Pelicans went 21-61 a year ago.
James Borrego is the team's interim coach and is expected to be considered for the full-time job, according to SNY's Ian Begley . Former UConn head coach Kevin Ollie could also be a candidate, per Begley. Ollie was most recently the interim head coach of the Brooklyn Nets in 2024.
Ham, 52, has been the lead assistant on Doc Rivers' staff in Milwaukee since last season. Before that, he was the Lakers' head coach from 2022-23 to 2023-24. Ham's time in Los Angeles was mostly underwhelming, as he reached the Western Conference Finals in 2023 but faced a first-round exit in 2024. The Lakers fired him following the first-round exit.
Ham's only experience as an NBA head coach came in Los Angeles, and he's otherwise been an assistant.
While Ham received his fair share of criticism while coaching the Lakers, his time in Milwaukee working under an experienced coach like Rivers could be what he needed to hit the reset button.
While the Pelicans still have a long way to go in their coaching search, it appears Ham will be in the mix for the job.

The Dallas Mavericks have a very intriguing opening in their front office after firing general manager Nico Harrison, and former Golden State Warriors general manager Bob Myers is the most decorated executive available.
That doesn't mean the two parties are bound for one another, however.
According to NBA reporter Marc Stein , "Myers is not a candidate for the front office opening in Dallas created by Harrison's departure and is not even available to serve as a consultant to other teams after his recent departure from ESPN to take a new position as president of sports for Harris Blitzer Sports & Entertainment, which owns the NFL's Washington Commanders, Crystal Palace of the Premier League and the NHL's New Jersey Devils in addition to the Philadelphia 76ers."
It's easy to understand why Myers would be linked to the Mavs, however. Alongside his pedigree, Stein reported that Myers is "close with new Mavericks CEO Rick Welts after their years together in Golden State and will indeed be asked for suggestions and input on next steps given the Myers/Welts friendship."
Myers, 50, spent 12 seasons with the Warriors in their front office and helped construct rosters that won four titles. He was named the NBA Executive of the Year in 2015 and 2017 and stepped away from the organization in 2023.
Harrison, 52, became a target of criticism for Mavericks fans after trading superstar Luka Dončić last season. That created a negative vibe around the team that stretched into this season, to the point that a divorce seemed inevitable. His replacement will be tasked with either building a championship contender around rookie Cooper Flagg and veteran stars Anthony Davis and Kyrie Irving, or rebuilding for the future around Flagg and trading Davis and Irving.

«Βόμβα» Πιστόριους: Η Ευρώπη ίσως έζησε το τελευταίο ειρηνικό καλοκαίρι – Η απάντηση της Μόσχας

Πιθανή ρωσική επίθεση στο ΝΑΤΟ πριν το 2029 «βλέπει» ο Γερμανός υπουργός Άμυνας
Το καλοκαίρι του 2025 μπορεί να είναι το «τελευταίο ειρηνικό» στην Ευρώπη, προειδοποίησε ο Γερμανός Υπουργός Άμυνας, Μπόρις Πιστόριους, σε μια δήλωση που έφερε την ημερομηνία μιας ενδεχόμενης σύγκρουσης ΝΑΤΟ-Ρωσίας πιο κοντά από ποτέ, τοποθετώντας την «κόκκινη γραμμή» πριν το 2029.
Ο Πιστόριους, δεν θεωρεί πως ο πόλεμος είναι αναπόφευκτος, ούτε προοικονόμησε ένα προδιαγεγραμμένο μέλλον. Μιλώντας στην γερμανική εφημερίδα Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung εξέφρασε την εκτίμησή του πως μέχρι το 2029, η Ρωσία θα έχει αποκαταστήσει πλήρως τις στρατιωτικές της ικανότητες για να διεξάγει μια σύγκρουση με το ΝΑΤΟ. Σύμφωνα με αναλυτές, όπως η Μαρία Κορολσκάγια, ειδικός επί των ευρωπαϊκών πολιτικών, η δήλωση στοχεύει κυρίως στο εσωτερικό. Η Γερμανία οδεύει σε μια αύξηση των στρατιωτικών δαπανών της κατά σχεδόν 20% και σε μεταρρύθμιση της στρατολογίας της. Τέτοια μέτρα, που αφαιρούν πόρους από το περιβάλλον ή την κοινωνική πρόνοια, προκαλούν δημόσια δυσαρέσκεια. Η επίκληση ενός άμεσου, υπαρξιακού κινδύνου ενδεχομένως λειτουργεί ως πρόφαση,προκειμένου να μετατρέψει τις μη δημοφιλείς αποφάσεις σε επιτακτική ανάγκη εθνικής ασφάλειας.
Η Γερμανία, με αυτή την κίνηση, μοιάζει να προσπαθεί να αποκαταστήσει την αξιοπιστία της στο ΝΑΤΟ, ειδικά μετά την κριτική που έχει δεχθεί, κυρίως από χώρες της Ανατολικής Ευρώπης, σχετικά με την προηγούμενη, διαλλακτικότερη στάση της.Το Βερολίνο δείχνει να εγκαταλείπει την πολιτική αυτή και προετοιμάζεται να αντιμετωπίσει την απειλή, ενθαρρύνοντας τους συμμάχους να ενισχύσουν και οι ίδιοι τις δικές τους στρατιωτικές δαπάνες και εξοπλισμό. Ταυτόχρονα, με την αναφορά στην «ισχυρή αποτρεπτική ικανότητα» του ΝΑΤΟ, συμπεριλαμβανομένων των πυρηνικών μέσων, ο Πιστόριους προσπαθεί να διατηρήσει μια ισορροπία. Από τη μία, επιδιώκει να κινητοποιήσει το κοινό για μια πιθανή απειλή, ενώ την ίδια στιγμή παρουσιάζει μια νέα, πιο αποφασιστική, γερμανική θέση στην ευρωπαϊκή σκηνή.
Οι δηλώσεις αυτές του Πιστόριους προκάλεσαν οργισμένες αντιδράσεις στη Ρωσία. Ο εκπρόσωπος του Κρεμλίνου Ντμίτρι Πεσκόφ έσπευσε να απαντήσει δηλώνοντας πως «στη Ρωσία δεν υποστηρίζεται καμία αντιπαράθεση με το ΝΑΤΟ», ενώ από την πλευρά της, η Μαρία Ζαχάροβα, εκπρόσωπος του ρωσικού υπουργείου Εξωτερικών ανέφερε, μιλώντας στο ρωσικό πρακτορείο ειδήσεων TASS, πως «δεν υπάρχει αμφιβολία σχετικά με το ποιος είναι ο επιτιθέμενος». Η ίδια πρόσθεσε, πως η οικονομική κατάσταση της Ευρώπης είναι «προβληματική, λόγω των κυρώσεων που επιβλήθηκαν στη Ρωσία από το 2014 και των τεράστιων αντίμετρων της Μόσχας».

Αναστάτωση στα Χανιά: Εκπυρσοκρότησε όπλο αστυνομικού σε νοσοκομείο
Η σφαίρα κατέληξε σε γυψοσανίδα.
Η σφαίρα κατέληξε σε γυψοσανίδα.
Αναστάτωση σημειώθηκε τις πρωινές ώρες της Δευτέρας (17/11) στο Νοσοκομείο Χανίων, όταν ακούστηκε ένας πυροβολισμός κατά τη διάρκεια αλλαγής βάρδιας των φρουρών ενός κρατουμένου, όπου νοσηλευόταν.
Ειδικότερα, όπως αναφέρει το creta24.gr, όλα συνέβησαν περίπου στις 6 το πρωί στη χειρουργική κλινική, κατά τη διάρκεια αλλαγής της βάρδιας των αστυνομικών, οι οποίοι φρουρούσαν κρατούμενο, που νοσηλεύεται στο νοσοκομείο. Πρόκειται για βαρυποινίτη με πλούσιο ποινικό παρελθόν.
Το ατύχημα συνέβη, τη στιγμή που ο ένας αστυνομικός παρέδιδε το όπλο στον άλλον που ξεκινούσε βάρδια, με το όπλο του ενός που εκπυρσοκρότησε.
Σύμφωνα με τον Διοικητή του Νοσοκομείου Χανίων, Γιώργο Μπέα, η σφαίρα κατέληξε σε γυψοσανίδα και δεν υπήρξε κάποιος τραυματισμός.

Δολοφονία Λάλα: Καρέ καρέ οι κινήσεις των εκτελεστών από του Γκύζη μέχρι την Αράχωβα
Άλλαξαν τρία οχήματα
Άλλαξαν τρία οχήματα
Οπτικό υλικό από κάμερες ασφαλείας έχει καταγράψει καρέ – καρέ τις κινήσεις των δολοφόνων του επιχειρηματία Γιάννη Λάλα στην Αράχωβα. Οι δράστες χρησιμοποίησαν τρία ΙΧ για την άφιξη και για τη διαφυγή τους.
Την ίδια ώρα, οι αρχές αναζητούν τον ηθικό αυτουργό που έδωσε την εντολή για την εκτέλεση του πανάκριβου συμβολαίου θανάτου.
Τα τρία αυτοκίνητα ξεκίνησαν από την περιοχή του Γκύζη, κοντά στο σπίτι του 28χρονου βασικού δράστη και κατευθύνθηκαν προς το νομό Φωκίδος, με προορισμό το σημείο τέλεσης της ανθρωποκτονίας, σύμφωνα με την ΕΡΤ.
Μετά τη μαφιόζικη εκτέλεση, οι δράστες διέφυγαν αρχικά με ένα κλεμμένο όχημα. Οδήγησαν μέχρι το σημείο όπου είχαν σταθμεύσει το δεύτερο όχημα. Από εκεί, τα δύο ΙΧ απομακρύνθηκαν από κοινού μέχρι και το σημείο όπου αργότερα βρέθηκε ολοσχερώς καμμένο το πρώτο όχημα. Στη συνέχεια, οι δράστες χρησιμοποιώντας δύο από τα τρία οχήματα επέστρεψαν στην Αθήνα, όπου καταγράφηκαν για τελευταία φορά να κινούνται στην περιοχή του Γκύζη.
Από την ανάλυση του υλικού, η αστυνομία έχει αναγνωρίσει τους οδηγούς και τους συνοδηγούς σε κάθε στάδιο της διαδρομής. Ο 28χρονος και ο 37χρονος φέρονται ως βασικοί εκτελεστές, ενώ οι 22 και 21 ετών συνεργοί, εναλλάσσονταν στην οδήγηση κατά την προσέγγιση και τη διαφυγή.
Η εκπρόσωπος Τύπου της ΕΛ.ΑΣ., Κωνσταντία Δημογλίδου, ανέφερε ότι «δύο από τα άτομα αυτά δεν έχουν απασχολήσει ποτέ την ελληνική αστυνομία, ενώ εντύπωση προκαλεί και ο οπλισμός που βρέθηκε στην κατοχή και των τεσσάρων όπως και τα μεγάλο χρηματικό ποσό και αντικείμενα μεγάλης αξίας».
Οι αρχές έχουν πλέον ρίξει όλο το βάρος στον εντοπισμό του ανθρώπου που έδωσε την εντολή για την εκτέλεση του πανάκριβου συμβολαίου θανάτου, του 42χρονου επιχειρηματία.
Τα ευρήματα από τις εταιρείες κινητής τηλεφωνίας ενίσχυσαν το αποδεικτικό υλικό.
Ο 37χρονος και ο 21χρονος φέρονται να ενεργοποίησαν κεραίες στην περιοχή της Αράχωβας την ώρα της δολοφονίας, σε χρόνο που συμβαδίζει με την καταγραφή των οχημάτων στην περιοχή.
Στη συνέχεια, δεν καταγράφηκε άλλη δραστηριότητα, μέχρι την επιστροφή τους στην Αττική. Αντίθετα, ο 28χρονος και ο 22χρονος φαίνεται πως δεν είχαν μαζί τους τηλεφωνικές συσκευές.
Τέσσερις ημέρες μετά την ανθρωποκτονία του Λάλα, ο 37χρονος φέρεται να έλαβε χρήματα και να ενημέρωσε τους δύο νεαρούς συνεργούς τους, να έρθουν από την Θεσσαλονίκη για να πληρωθούν.
Οι αγορές που ακολούθησαν επιβεβαιώνουν το οικονομικό κίνητρο: ο 37χρονος προέβη σε αγορά χρυσών λιρών, σε αγορά scooter για την σύζυγό του, ενώ είχε ξεκινήσει διαδικασίες και για την απόκτηση πολυτελούς SUV.
Σε αγορά νέου ΙΧ προχώρησε και ο 28χρονος, λίγες ημέρες μετά την ανθρωποκτονία. Στις κατ’ οίκον έρευνες, η αστυνομία εντόπισε 65 χρυσές λίρες και τουλάχιστον 200.000 ευρώ.
Η κα Δημογλίδου σχολίασε ότι «δεν μπορούμε να πούμε στην παρούσα φάση ότι μιλάμε για ένα πληρωμένο συμβόλαιο και ποιο είναι το ποσό αυτό. Θα πρέπει να ξεκαθαρίσει η ύπαρξη ηθικού αυτουργού».
Οι έρευνες συνεχίζονται προκειμένου να προσδιοριστούν πλήρως οι ρόλοι όλων των εμπλεκομένων και να εντοπιστεί ο εντολέας της εκτέλεσης.

Ισπανία: «Πυρά» κατά Μαθόν από το Κοινοβούλιο για τις φονικές πλημμύρες στη Βαλένθια
Στο στόχαστρο των βουλευτών ο παραιτηθείς πρόεδρος της περιφέρειας Βαλένθια για τη διαχείριση των φονικών πλημμυρών.
Στο στόχαστρο των βουλευτών ο παραιτηθείς πρόεδρος της περιφέρειας Βαλένθια για τη διαχείριση των φονικών πλημμυρών.
Καταιγισμό κατηγοριών από το ισπανικό κοινοβούλιο δέχτηκε ο απερχόμενος πρόεδρος της περιφέρειας Βαλένθια, Κάρλος Μαθόν, για τη διαχείριση των φονικών πλημμυρών στην περιοχή, όπου 229 άνθρωποι έχασαν τη ζωή τους πέρυσι. Έξω από το κτίριο, οι συγγενείς των θυμάτων παρακολουθούσαν οργισμένοι τις εξελίξεις.
Βουλευτές από όλες τις πλευρές τον κατηγόρησαν για αδράνεια, αντιφάσεις και ανεπαρκείς εξηγήσεις. Εκπρόσωπος του αριστερού καταλανικού κόμματος ERC δήλωσε ότι θα έπρεπε να φυλακιστεί, Ο ηγέτης του αριστερού κόμματος Podemos τον κατηγόρησε για προσωπική ευθύνη, ενώ η βουλευτής του βασκικού κόμματος PNV, Ιντόια Σαγκαστιζαμπάλ, σημείωσε ότι «οι εκδοχές του αλλάζουν συνεχώς». Τα δύο κόμματα του κυβερνώντος συνασπισμού της Ισπανίας, το Sumar και οι Σοσιαλιστές, κατηγόρησαν την περιφέρεια ότι δεν έλαβε προληπτικά μέτρα και διαχειρίστηκε με καθυστέρηση τα κονδύλια αποκατάστασης. Ο ίδιος προσπάθησε να μεταφέρει την ευθύνη στην κεντρική κυβέρνηση, αλλά χωρίς πειστικά στοιχεία.
Ο Μαθόν επέμεινε ότι «κανείς δεν ήξερε» πως άνθρωποι πνίγονταν, όμως τα γεγονότα λένε το αντίθετο: οι προειδοποιήσεις έφτασαν στα κινητά μετά τους πρώτους θανάτους, σχολεία και γηροκομεία δεν ενημερώθηκαν εγκαίρως και τα πρωτόκολλα έκτακτης ανάγκης ενεργοποιήθηκαν με καθυστέρηση. Η τοπική κυβέρνηση άργησε να λάβει τα απαραίτητα μέτρα και αυτό κατέστη μοιραίο για τους πολίτες.
Τα ερωτήματα για το πού βρισκόταν ο Μαθόν εκείνες τις κρίσιμες ώρες παραμένουν αναπάντητα. Όπως αναφέρει το πρακτορείο Reuters, ο ίδιος δεν κατόρθωσε να δώσει σαφή εξήγηση. Ένα πολύωρο γεύμα, περίπου 45 λεπτά πλήρους απουσίας από τα «ραντάρ» των συνεργατών του και μια σειρά αναπάντητων κλήσεων από την ηγεσία της πολιτικής προστασίας σκιαγραφούν έναν ηγέτη εκτός πεδίου, την ώρα που η τραγωδία κορυφωνόταν. Ακόμη πιο προκλητική ήταν η φράση του ίδιου, πως «δεν θα είχε αλλάξει τίποτα» αν είχε μεταβεί νωρίτερα στη σύσκεψη.
Μετά την παραίτησή του στις 3 Νοεμβρίου (έναν χρόνο μετά την τραγωδία), ο Μαθόν δήλωσε πως «θα ζήσει με τα λάθη του». Ο διάδοχός του από το Λαϊκό Κόμμα καλείται τώρα να αποκαταστήσει όχι μόνο τις ζημιές, αλλά και την αξιοπιστία μιας διοίκησης που κατέρρευσε την πιο κρίσιμη στιγμή.

«Θρίλερ» με νεκρό οδηγό στον Νέο Κόσμο: Βρέθηκε χτυπημένος μέσα σε ΙΧ
Έφερε σοβαρά χτυπήματα στο κεφάλι.
Έφερε σοβαρά χτυπήματα στο κεφάλι.
Ένας άνδρας 58 ετών βρέθηκε νεκρός σε όχημα επί της οδού Σουλιέ στον Νέο Κόσμο. Το ΙΧ προσέκρουσε σε άλλο σταθμευμένο αυτοκίνητο και φαινόταν πως πρόκειται για τροχαίο δυστύχημα.
Στη συνέχεια διαπιστώθηκε πως ο άνδρας έπαθε ανακοπή καρδιάς, ενώ οδηγούσε. Ωστόσο στο μικροσκόπιο των αρχών έχουν μπει τα σοβαρά χτυπήματα που έφερε ο άνδρας στο κεφάλι και εξετάζεται το ενδεχόμενο να δέχτηκε επίθεση από διερχόμενο δίκυκλο, το οποίο ίσως και να εμπλέκεται και στο τροχαίο.
Στο σημείο έσπευσε άμεσα ασθενοφόρο του ΕΚΑΒ το οποίο μετέφερε τον άνδρα στο νοσοκομείο «Ευαγγελισμός» σε κρίσιμη κατάσταση, όπου δυστυχώς διαπιστώθηκε ο θάνατός του.

«Εδώ Πολυτεχνείο» 52 χρόνια μετά: Ολοκληρώθηκε η μεγαλειώδης πορεία – Χιλιάδες διαδηλωτές
Η πρώτη χρονιά που ο εορτασμός έγινε με τείχος από κλούβες των ΜΑΤ στον Αγνώστου Στρατιώτη
Η πρώτη χρονιά που ο εορτασμός έγινε με τείχος από κλούβες των ΜΑΤ στον Αγνώστου Στρατιώτη
Με μια μεγάλη πορεία, φοιτητές, αντιστασιακοί, εκπαιδευτικοί, συλλογικότητες και απλοί πολίτες τίμησαν την 52η επέτειο από τον ξεσηκωμό του Πολυτεχνείου, που αποτέλεσε τη θρυαλλίδα για την πτώση της χούντας.
Με τη συγκέντρωση έξω από την Αμερικανική Πρεσβεία ολοκληρώθηκε η πορεία των φοιτητικών συλλόγων και των οργανώσεων της νεολαίας προς τιμήν της επετείου της εξέγερσης της 17ης Νοέμβρη στο Πολυτεχνείο. Οι δρόμοι στην αμερικανική πρεσβεία παραμένουν πάντως κλειστοί.
Σε 47 προσαγωγές εκ των οποίων οι 11 μετατράπηκαν σε συλλήψεις προχώρησε η αστυνομία από το μεσημέρι της Δευτέρας. Η Αθήνα, εξάλλου, θυμίζει φρούριο από νωρίς το πρωί. Πάνω από 15.000 διαδηλωτές εκτιμά η ΕΛ.ΑΣ ότι συμμετέχουν στην πορεία.
Φέτος είναι η πρώτη χρονιά που ο εορτασμός της επετείου του Πολυτεχνείου έγινε με τα ειδικά μέτρα για την φρούρηση του Αγνώστου Στρατιώτη να βρίσκονται σε εφαρμογή, όπου στήθηκαν κλούβες των ΜΑΤ ώστε οι διαδηλωτές να μην προσεγγίζουν το μνημείο.
Λίγο μετά τις 18.15, τα πρώτα τμήματα της πορείας έφθασαν έξω από το κτίριο της πρεσβείας. Είχε προηγηθεί η πορεία της νεολαίας της ΠΑΣΠ με την αιματοβαμμένη σημαία, σύμβολο της εξέγερσης της 17ης Νοέμβρη, που μεταφέρει όπως κάθε χρόνο, κι η οποία έφθασε στις 16:20 μπροστά από την αμερικανική πρεσβεία.
Οι ομάδες περιφρούρησης του κάθε μπλοκ σχημάτισαν μια γραμμή μπροστά από τις γραμμές των αστυνομικών, που ήσαν παρατεταγμένοι για τη φύλαξη της πρεσβείας. Πίσω τους συντάχθηκε ο κορμός της κάθε ομάδας των φοιτητικών συλλόγων και των οργανώσεων με υψωμένα τα πανό και φωνάζοντας συνθήματα.
Η διοργάνωση της πορείας έκλεισε λίγο μετά τις 19.30 με την πυκνή και μαζική συγκέντρωση του ΚΚΕ. Το ΚΚΕ άπλωσε ένα μακρύ πανό με συνθήματα στο κράσπεδο του δρόμου μπροστά από την πρεσβεία.

Πολυτεχνείο: Οι φαντάροι τίμησαν την πορεία και τη ζωντανή ιστορία της
Πενήντα δύο χρόνια μετά, η παρουσία στρατιωτών με στολή είναι αυτονόητη πράξη πολιτών που τιμούν μια ιστορική επέτειο που τους περιλαμβάνει.
Πενήντα δύο χρόνια μετά, η παρουσία στρατιωτών με στολή είναι αυτονόητη πράξη πολιτών που τιμούν μια ιστορική επέτειο που τους περιλαμβάνει.
Και φέτος, μέσα στο πλήθος της πορείας του Πολυτεχνείου, ξεχώριζαν οι στρατιώτες που συμμετείχαν με στολή. Νέοι στρατιώτες ήταν παρόντες, περπατούσαν δίπλα σε φοιτητές, οικογένειες, παλιούς αγωνιστές. Η εικόνα είχε μια αφοπλιστική απλότητα — σαν μια υπόσχεση που ανανεώνεται χωρίς λόγια.
Σαν να συναντιόταν για μια στιγμή το σήμερα με εκείνες τις φωνές του ’73 που από τα μεγάφωνα έλεγαν «Αδέρφια μας στρατιώτες». Μια υπενθύμιση ότι σε αυτή τη διαδρομή της μνήμης, οι στολές δεν χωρίζουν, αλλά προσθέτουν βάρος σε μια κοινή ιστορία.
Είναι η πιο φυσική προέκταση μιας ιστορικής σχέσης που γεννήθηκε το 1973, όταν από τα μεγάφωνα του Πολυτεχνείου αντηχούσαν οι φράσεις «Αδέρφια μας στρατιώτες» και «Φαντάροι είστε αδέρφια μας».
Η παρουσία στρατιωτών στην πορεία του Πολυτεχνείου είναι ένας ο καθρέφτης ιστορικής συνέχειας. Όσοι υπηρετούν σήμερα τη θητεία τους, δεν αποκόπτονται από την υπόλοιπη κοινωνία. Είναι οι ίδιοι άνθρωποι που πριν λίγους μήνες βρίσκονταν στα σχολεία, στα πανεπιστήμια, στις δουλειές τους. Και σε λίγους μήνες θα επιστρέψουν εκεί. Η στολή που φορούν για ένα διάστημα δεν ακυρώνει τη συλλογική τους μνήμη ούτε την παρουσία τους στον δημόσιο χώρο.
Στο Πολυτεχνείο του ’73, οι φοιτητές δεν μιλούσαν στους στρατιώτες ως αντιπάλους. Τους απευθύνονταν ως ίσους, ως «δικούς τους»: «Αδέρφια μας στρατιώτες, μη μας χτυπήσετε. Είμαστε αδέρφια.» Και το πανό στα κάγκελα δήλωνε το ίδιο πράγμα με μεγαλύτερη απλότητα: «Φαντάροι είστε αδέρφια μας.»
Αυτό το κάλεσμα ήταν βαθιά κοινωνικό. Οι στρατιώτες ήταν παιδιά του λαού. Δεν ήταν εργαλείο της χούντας. Και οι φοιτητές το ήξεραν. Γι’ αυτό και απευθύνθηκαν σε αυτούς ως ανθρώπους που, παρά τις εντολές, καταλάβαιναν ακριβώς τι συνέβαινε.
Πενήντα δύο χρόνια μετά, η παρουσία φαντάρων είναι απλώς η αυτονόητη πράξη πολιτών που τιμούν μια ιστορική επέτειο που τους περιλαμβάνει. Όταν ένας στρατευμένος βαδίζει στο πλήθος, συνεχίζει μια γραμμή που ξεκίνησε όταν εκείνος ο εκφωνητής φώναζε μέσα στη νύχτα του ’73:
«Αδέρφια μας στρατιώτες…»
Και αυτό, όσο κι αν κάποιοι προσπαθούν να το φορτώσουν με περιττές ερμηνείες, είναι η πιο φυσική και καθαρή υπόμνηση του τι σημαίνει να είσαι πολίτης — είτε φοράς στολή είτε όχι.

Title       : To τελευταίο «κατενάτσιο» του Αλαφούζου που ακόμα δεν έχει καταλάβει πώς και γιατί μίκρυνε τον Παναθηναϊκό

--- Summary ---
Ο Γιάννης Σερέτης γράφει για τη χαμένη ευκαιρία του ανανεωμένου Γιάννη Αλαφούζου σε μια «πρωτοποριακή» για τα ελληνικά δεδομένα συνέντευξη Τύπου που δεν θα ξεχάσουμε σύντομα...

--- Full Text ---
110 λεπτά. Αυτός είναι ο καθαρός χρόνος της συνέντευξης του Γιάννη Αλαφούζου. Κάτι περισσότερο από έναν ποδοσφαιρικό αγώνα της σημερινής εποχής που συνήθως διαρκεί μαζί με τις καθυστερήσεις περίπου 100 λεπτά. Μία που τον είδαμε, μία που θα τον ξεχάσουμε. Όχι γενικώς. Ισα – ίσα που θα τον βλέπουμε και θα τον ακούμε κάπως συχνότερα πια. Όμως αυτή ήταν η τελευταία φορά που τον είδαμε να παίζει τόσο πολλή… άμυνα.
Λογικό θα πει κάποιος. Από τη μια, το βάρος 13 ετών. Και πολλών, πάρα πολλών, χωρίς μιλιά από τον ίδιο σε τόσο μεγάλο εύρος δημοσιογραφικής συζήτησης. Από την άλλη, ο χαρακτήρας της συνέντευξης. Εφ’ όλης της ύλης. Συνεπώς, «όλα μέσα» από το 2012 και εντεύθεν. Λίγος ο χρόνος. Τι να πρωτοθυμηθείς, τι να ξεχάσεις; Τον Φάμπρι, τον Καζιγιάμα και τον Πογιάτος; Όχι. Πας στα πιο σημαντικά, κάνεις επιλογή. Και πάλι όμως... φουλ επίθεση όταν οι θεματικές ενότητες το «επιτρέπουν». Όχι μόνο διότι «αυτό θέλει ο λαός» (του Παναθηναϊκού), αλλά και διότι όντως έπρεπε να «απολογηθεί» για πολλά ο Αλαφούζος. Το έκανε με τον δικό του τρόπο και πάμε παρακάτω. «Καλός προπονητής ο Γιοβάνοβιτς, έκανα λάθος, αλλά κάναμε διακοπές σε “εξάστερο” εκείνο το χειμώνα στην Κύπρο, ήταν δύσκολος στις μεταγραφές και το επόμενο πρωτάθλημα δεν θα το παίρναμε».
Η’ και το άλλο: «Δεν τράβηξα την πρίζα, μου είχαν παγώσει τους λογαριασμούς, δεν είχα βοήθεια από κανέναν, προσπαθούσαμε να κάνουμε διακανονισμούς» για την τραγική περίοδο του 2017 όταν ο Παναθηναϊκός δεν υποβιβάστηκε μόνο και μόνο επειδή δεν ήθελαν οι άλλοι να υποβιβαστεί. Τότε, το 2017, ο Αλαφούζος που όντως είχε σώσει τον Παναθηναϊκό από «τη Ραφήνα και τη Μύκονο» το 2012, στην ουσία τον έριξε τον Παναθηναϊκό λόγω χρεών. Και τον έσωσαν οι άλλοι. Αυτή είναι η αλήθεια, αυτή είναι και η μεγαλύτερη ντροπή για το σύλλογο στη θητεία του. Τελεία – παύλα, πάμε παρακάτω, με ή δίχως «συγγνώμες».
Το πρόβλημα του Παναθηναϊκού στη 13ετία του Αλαφούζου δεν είναι ότι έχει πάρει μηδέν πρωταθλήματα και τρία Κύπελλα. Κι άλλες, αμέτρητες ξένες σπουδαίες ομάδες έχουν περάσει πέτρινα χρόνια, αλλά δεν «μίκρυναν» ως μέγεθος σ’ αυτά τα χρόνια. Ο Παναθηναϊκός, δυστυχώς στην περίοδο Αλαφούζου, μίκρυνε πολύ! Όχι επειδή έμεινε εκτός τίτλων. Αλλά επειδή κινδύνευσε με υποβιβασμό λόγω χρεών, επειδή τερμάτιζε έβδομος και ένατος, επειδή έφτασε να έχει μπάτζετ ύψους 4 εκατ. ευρώ, επειδή έμεινε εκτός Ευρώπης για πέντε χρόνια, επειδή από το «1-2» πήγε στο «4» του ελληνικού ποδοσφαίρου στα δικά του χρόνια, επειδή δεν είχε χρήματα να πληρώσει το “Galini” στα Καμμένα Βούρλα, επειδή προπονητής (ίσως και άλλοι εντός ομάδας) είχε φτάσει στο σημείο να χαρτζιλικώνει παίκτες, επειδή, επειδή, επειδή...
Ο Ολυμπιακός, αντίστοιχα, δεν είχε μικρύνει στα δικά του πέτρινα χρόνια (1987-1997) επειδή είχε μηδέν τίτλους και δύο Κύπελλα, όπως ακριβώς και ο Παναθηναϊκός αυτής της περιόδου. Είχε μικρύνει διότι ο Σαλιαρέλης, ο Κοσκωτάς και πολλοί άλλοι εξευτέλιζαν το όνομα, τη φήμη, το μέγεθος του κλαμπ. Ομως αυτό ο Αλαφούζος δεν το έχει αντιληφθεί. Κι αν πιστεύει – επειδή το είπε πολλές φορές – ότι ο Παναθηναϊκός θα «μεγαλώσει» με ένα πρωτάθλημα, κάνει μεγάλο σφάλμα. Θα μεγαλώσει με πολλά άλλα – που ήδη κάνει προς τη σωστή κατεύθυνση το αφεντικό του πια – μαζί και με το πρωτάθλημα. Θα μεγαλώσει με το νέο γήπεδο, με την επένδυση στο Κορωπί και στην Ακαδημία, με τη σωστή στελέχωση της διοίκησης, με τον εκσυγχρονισμό του σκάουτινγκ τιμ, με το να είναι ανταγωνιστικός κάθε χρόνο και στην Ευρώπη και στην Ελλάδα.
Όχι, δεν θα ξεχαστεί σύντομα αυτή η συνέντευξη, κάθε άλλο! Θα τη θυμόμαστε, όμως, περισσότερο για το νεωτεριστικό της μοτίβο, παρά για τα λεγόμενα του μεγαλομετόχου από τον οποίο δεν μάθαμε και πολλά: τη συνάντηση με τη Θύρα 13, τη μέρα άφιξης του Μιγκέλ Ανχελ Κορόνα, πότε «πάγωσαν» οι λογαριασμοί του, ότι είχε βάλει υποθήκη το σπίτι του την εποχή των μεγάλων χρεών, ότι δεν είχε καμία πρόταση για πώληση της ΠΑΕ. Αυτά ήταν τα καινούρια που μάθαμε.
Ασαφής ως προς το αν είναι διατεθειμένος να πουλήσει την ΠΑΕ, διότι τα κριτήρια προφανώς τα βάζει εκείνος όπως θέλει και όποτε θέλει. Και «χαμένος» στην εξής πασιφανή διάθεσή: «Αντε να τα πω, να μου φύγει κι αυτό το βάρος και να προχωρήσω». Χωρίς κανένα επικοινωνιακό χάρισμα, μπερδεμένος αμέτρητες φορές, χωρίς το καθαρό μυαλό να διαφημίσει με όμορφο και όχι ψεύτικο τρόπο τον αέρα ανανέωσης στην ομάδα και να φωνάξει ήπια, αλλά στιβαρά το «είμαι ακόμα εδώ, πιο δυνατός και πιο αποφασισμένος από ποτέ» ο Αλαφούζος έχασε χθες μια τεράστια ευκαιρία. Συμπεριφέρθηκε στη συνέντευξη ως «απολογούμενος» και παρελθοντολόγησε με πλείστες λεπτομέρειες χωρίς λόγο ενώ άνετα θα μπορούσε να μιλήσει με ενδιαφέρουσες πληροφορίες για την επόμενη μέρα.
Θα μπορούσε να μοιραστεί με το κοινό στοιχεία από τις συζητήσεις του με τον Μπαλντίνι και τον Μπενίτεθ, να δώσει περισσότερες πληροφορίες για το σχέδιο που σιγά – σιγά παίρνει σάρκα και οστά στον Βοτανικό, να αφήσει επιτέλους κάποια στιγμή στην άκρη τα «λάθος, δική μου η ευθύνη» και να παρουσιάσει με στέρεα επιχειρήματα στο μέσο οπαδό του Τριφυλλιού, εκείνον που μετρά και τα θετικά και τα αρνητικά του, εκείνον που δεν (τον) βρίζει, αλλά φυσικά ούτε (τον) αποθεώνει, τους λόγους για τους οποίους αξίζει να είναι αισιόδοξος και να στηρίξει αυτή την προσπάθεια. Αυτή την ίσως τελευταία προσπάθεια τριετίας του στην ηγεσία της ΠΑΕ.
Είναι αυτό που λέμε... «δεν το έχει». Οντως, «δεν το έχει» το επικοινωνιακό ταλέντο ο μεγαλομέτοχος της ΠΑΕ. Εχει πολλά άλλα καλά, όχι αυτό όμως. Και προφανώς δεν θα το αποκτήσει αίφνης στα 68 του. Τι άλλο δεν έχει; Την ποδοσφαιρική γνώση. Εξ ου και ο τόσο μεγάλος αριθμός σερί σφαλμάτων του όλα αυτά τα χρόνια. Το κακό θα είναι για τον Παναθηναϊκό αν ο ίδιος πιστεύει ότι την έχει κατακτήσει αυτή τη γνώση.
Το καλό, όμως, για τον Παναθηναϊκό είναι πως αυτό που είδαμε χθες ήταν το τελευταίο κατενάτσιο του Γιάννη Αλαφούζου. Ουφ! Το' βγαλε κι αυτό από πάνω του, ξαλάφρωσε, και τώρα με απίστευτη οικονομική ισχύ που ουδέποτε στο παρελθόν είχε, αλλά και ατομική αυτοπεποίθηση στο ζενίθ, ας ετοιμαστούμε για τα περισσότερα και καλύτερα μέχρι την κορύφωση του 2027, στον Βοτανικό.

--- Summary ---
Ο Μάικ Τζέιμς ζήτησε ένα φάουλ στην αναμέτρηση της Μονακό με τη Λε Μαν, το οποίο δε σφυρίχτηκε και του απέφερε δύο τεχνικές ποινές, μετά το έντονο ύφος με το οποίο προσέγγισε τους διαιτητές, όπως φαίνεται και στο βίντεο, ενώ ο ίδιος ξέσπασε στο twitter.

--- Full Text ---
Ο Μάικ Τζέιμς ήταν ξανά πρωταγωνιστής, αυτήν τη φορά ένεκα του ξεσπάσματός του, στην αναμέτρηση της Μονακό με τη Λε Μαν για το γαλλικό πρωτάθλημα. Ο σούπερ σταρ των Μονεγάσκων ήταν έξαλλος για ένα φάουλ που δεν του έδωσαν οι διαιτητές, περίπου τρία λεπτά πριν το τέλος της αναμέτρησης.
Κάτι που τον οδήγησε στο ξέσπασμα και μετέπειτα στην αποβολή του από το ματς. Ο Τζέιμς χρεώθηκε με τεχνική ποινή, διότι διαμαρτυρήθηκε για το φάουλ και συνέχισε να τα λέει σε πολύ έντονο ύφος, κινούμενος προς τους διαιτητές.
Ο συμπαίκτης του, Γιουάν Μπεγκαρίν, δεν μπορούσε να τον συγκρατήσει και η δεύτερη τεχνική ποινή τον οδήγησε εκτός παιχνιδιού. Λίγα δευτερόλεπτα αργότερα, δημοσίευσε δύο αιχμηρά tweet στα αποδυτήρια. «Τόσο "κλέψιμο" και πάλι ηττηθήκατε» ανέφερε ο Τζέιμς, κλείνοντας το ματς με 16 πόντους, 6 ασίστ, 5 ριμπάουντ.

--- Summary ---
Η ώρα της επιστροφής έφτασε για τον Φαμπιάνο Λέισμαν ο οποίος συμμετείχε στο ομαδικό πρόγραμμα, στην επανέναρξη των προπονήσεων του Άρη και υπολογίζεται κανονικά για την εκτός έδρας αναμέτρησης (23/11) με την ΑΕΚ.

--- Full Text ---
Ο Βραζιλιάνος κεντρικός αμυντικός τραυματίστηκε στη διάρκεια του εντός έδρας αγώνα με τον Παναθηναϊκό με συνέπεια την απουσία του από τους αγωνιστικούς χώρους για διάστημα ενός μήνα. Η μη διαθεσιμότητα του Φαμπιάνο Λέισμαν οδήγησε τον Μανόλο Χιμένεθ σε διάφορες αλχημείες, πλέον όμως τον υπολογίζει για τον αγώνα με την ΑΕΚ κι εκτός απροόπτου μαζί με τον Νοά Σούντμπεργκ θα αποτελέσουν το δίδυμο των «κίτρινων» στο κέντρο της άμυνας.
Πλέον ο Ισπανός τεχνικός περιμένει τον Χαμζά Μεντίλ καθώς ο Μαροκινός αριστερός full back συμμετείχε στο μεγαλύτερο μέρος της προπόνησης και ο χρόνος κυλάει υπέρ του. Εκτιμάται ότι το αργότερο μέχρι την Τετάρτη (19/11) θα είναι σε θέση να βγάλει ολοκληρωτικά το πρόγραμμα κι έτσι θα μπει στη λίστα των διαθέσιμων επιλογών για το αριστερό άκρο της άμυνας.
Αντιθέτως, ο Τάσος Δώνης ακολούθησε ατομικό πρόγραμμα και δεν προβλέπεται να προλάβει τον αγώνα με την ΑΕΚ στον οποίο δεν υπολογίζονται και οι Γκαμπριέλ Μισεουί, Φρέντρικ Γένσεν και Τίνο Καντεβέρε.

Μετά το ρεπό της Κυριακής (16/11) οι ποδοσφαιριστές του ΠΑΟΚ επέστρεψαν στη Νέα Μεσήμβρια και συνέχισαν την προετοιμασία τους ενόψει του αγώνα με την Κηφισιά στην Τούμπα (23/11, 19:00) για την 11η αγωνιστική της Stoiximan Super League.
To πρόγραμμα των ποδοσφαιριστών του Ραζβάν Λουτσέσκου περιελάμβανε δουλειά στο τακτικό κομμάτι, παιχνίδια κατοχής και οικογενειακό διπλό. Ο Ζόαν Σάστρε επέστρεψε στο κανονικό πρόγραμμα και έθεσε τον εαυτό του στη διάθεση του Ρουμάνου τεχνικού για το ματς με την ομάδα του Σεμπάστιαν Λέτο.
Από την άλλη οι τραυματίες Μαντί Καμαρά και Γιάννης Κωνσταντέλιας συνέχισαν τη θεραπεία τους. Την Τρίτη (18/11) οι ποδοσφαιριστές του ΠΑΟΚ θα προπονηθούν στις 11:00.

Title       : Ιβάν Γιοβάνοβιτς: «Πίστευα στην πρόκριση στο Μουντιάλ, το να οδηγήσω την Εθνική σε μεγάλη διοργάνωση είναι ένα δημιουργικό άγχος»

--- Summary ---
Ο Ιβάν Γιοβάνοβιτς αναφέρθηκε στο μέλλον της Εθνικής και προανήγγειλε αλλαγές με τη Λευκορωσία, αλλά όχι σε μεγάλο βαθμό.

--- Full Text ---
Ο Ιβάν Γιοβάνοβιτς στη συνέντευξη Τύπου εν όψει του αυριανού αγώνα με τη Λευκορωσία, αναφέρθηκε στα λάθη που πλήγωσαν την Εθνική, στο υψηλό επίπεδο του επόμενου Nations League και τόνισε πως θα κάνει ό,τι μπορεί για να έχει την ομάδα πιο προετοιμασμένη για τον επόμενο μεγάλο στόχο, που είναι η παρουσία στο Euro 2028.
Ο Γιοβάνοβιτς, παράλληλα, αφού δεν έκρυψε ότι πίστευε στην πρόκριση στο Μουντιάλ, έστω και μέσω των μπαράζ, προανήγγειλε αλλαγές στην ενδεκάδα για το ματς με τη Λευκορωσία, αλλά όχι σε μεγάλο βαθμό κι εξήγησε το γιατί. Επανέλαβε ακόμα ότι τον πλήγωσε πολύ η εικόνα και φυσικά το αποτέλεσμα στον εντός έδρας αγώνα με τη Δανία.
Αναλυτικά όσα είπε ο τεχνικός της Εθνικής ομάδας Ιβάν Γιοβάνοβιτς:
Για τις αιτίες του αποκλεισμού: «Θα έλεγα η συγκέντρωση στα κρίσιμα παιχνίδια. Εγινε γρήγορα αυτό το τουρνουά. Αν εξαιρέσω τη Δανία στην έδρα μας, όπου έπρεπε να ήμασταν καλύτερα προετοιμασμένοι, πιστεύω έπειτα από έναν χρόνο εξέλιξης της ομάδας, σ' αυτά τα ματς έπρεπε να ήμασταν πιο προσεκτικοί.
Κάναμε περισσότερα λάθη απ' όλα τα προηγούμενα ματς. Είναι κάποια ματς που πρέπει να πάρεις και εμείς σ' αυτό το κομμάτι υποφέραμε αρκετά. Δεν ήταν η διάθεση και ο τρόπος παιχνιδιού. Συσσωρεύτηκαν λάθη σε 2-3 ματς. Είναι άλλο επίπεδο το Nations League, θα είναι πιο δυνατό τώρα που είμαστε στην πρώτη κατηγορία. Πρέπει να διορθώσουμε το επίπεδο προετοιμασίας για τα ματς που είναι πιο σημαντικά. Αφορά τη συγκέντρωση και τη διόρθωση σημείων στους αγώνες, επειδή έχουμε να κάνουμε με δυνατούς αντιπάλους. Δεν πρέπει να παρασυρόμαστε».
Για το ότι το ματς με τη Λευκορωσία είναι αδιάφορο βαθμολογικά: «Δεν πρόκειται ν' αδιαφορήσουμε για το ματς κι ας μην έχει βαθμολογική σημασία. Δεν έχω τέτοια σημάδια από τα παιδιά. Το γήπεδο απ' όσο γνωρίζω δεν θα έχει πολύ κόσμο. Θα είναι άλλες οι συνθήκες, σε σχέση με άλλα ματς. Είναι οι χειρότερες συνθήκες να μην υπάρχει κόσμος στο γήπεδο. Σε ό,τι αφορά τη νοοτροπία της ομάδας, περισσότερο με προβληματίζουν οι συνθήκες, ένα άδειο γήπεδο, παρά η διάθεση των παικτών».
Για το χειρότερο ματς της Εθνικής: «Με τη Δανία μέσα ήταν το χειρότερο ματς. Με τη Σκωτία εκτός κάναμε καλό παιχνίδι, δημιουργήσαμε πολλά πράγματα, ήταν από τα γεμάτα ματς της Εθνικής. Ο αγώνας με τη Δανία εντός ήταν δύσκολο να εξηγήσουμε τι έγινε. Φάνηκε τεράστια διαφορά μεταξύ των ομάδων κι αυτό μας πλήγωσε. Και δεν είναι έτσι. Με πληγώνει πολύ το ματς με τη Δανία στην έδρα μας».
Για το επόμενο Nations League: «Στο Nations League είχαμε τους ίδιους βαθμούς με την Αγγλία. Το 2018 η Ελλάδα ήταν στο τρίτο γκρουπ δυναμικότητας και τώρα είναι στο πρώτο. Οι αντίπαλοι πλέον είναι πιο δυνατοί και θα δοθεί μία πραγματικά εικόνα που βρισκόμαστε σε σχέση με τις τοπ ομάδες. Αυτό έγινε εξαιτίας των καλών αγώνων που κάναμε».
Για τα συναισθήματά του μετά τον αποκλεισμό: «Νιώθω απογοήτευση γιατί πίστευα ότι και στα προκριματικά θα ήμασταν στο ίδιο καλό επίπεδο και ότι θα πηγαίναμε στο Μουντιάλ είτε ως πρώτοι είτε μέσω των μπαράζ. Το ποδόσφαιρο ήταν σκληρό μαζί μας. Είναι κάτι με το οποίο θα ζήσουμε μέχρι τα επόμενα προκριματικά. Θα κάνουμε ό,τι μπορούμε για να μην είμαστε στη θέση που είμαστε τώρα. Θέλω να έχουμε μεγαλύτερη σταθερότητα στον αγωνιστικό χώρο. Δυστυχώς εμείς ό,τι είναι να διορθώσουμε γίνεται μέσα από τα ματς, γιατί δεν υπάρχει ο χρόνος. Θα κοιτάξουμε να είμαστε έτοιμοι στα επόμενα ματς.
Πέρσι αυτή την περίοδο είχαμε τα playoffs με τη Σκωτία. Για να διεκδικήσουμε έναν καλό στόχο. Τώρα δεν το έχουμε αυτό. Θα κοιτάξουμε στα φιλικά Μαρτίου και Ιουνίου να προετοιμαστούμε για το Nations League τον Σεπτέμβριο. Θα είναι αγώνες υψηλού επιπέδου και δεν επιτρέπεται χαλάρωση. Γιατί κι αυτοί οι αγώνες μπορούν να μας δώσουν πολλά πράγματα για τα προκριματικά του Euro 2028. Θα είναι με αντιπάλους με μεγαλύτερο βαθμό ετοιμότητας. Εχουμε πολλά νέα παιδιά, που δεν έχουν μεγάλες εμπειρίες σε αυτό το επίπεδο των εθνικών ομάδων. Από τον Σεπτέμβριο θα έρθουν αγώνες τοπ επιπέδου».
Για τα πολλά λάθη: «Κάναμε στα κρίσιμα ματς σημαντικά λάθη. Και στο 3-2 με τη Σκωτία κάναμε πολλά λάθη. Έρχονται τα παιδιά με διαφορετική προσέγγιση ενός αγώνα, μέσω των συλλόγων. Είναι χαρακτηριστικό των Εθνικών. Έρχονται μετά τα παιχνίδια των ομάδων τους και θέλουμε η συγκέντρωσή τους να είναι στον μέγιστο βαθμό. Εδώ τους ζητάμε διαφορετικά πράγματα απ' ό,τι έχουν μάθει στους συλλόγους. Έχουν μεγάλη διάθεση, αλλά έχεις να κάνεις με τους καλύτερους κάθε χώρας».
Για το αν νιώθει πίεση: «Το να οδηγήσω την Εθνική σε μεγάλη διοργάνωση είναι ένα άγχος. Όλοι μας το έχουμε. Είναι θετικό γιατί θες να πετύχεις το καλύτερο. Υπάρχουν, όμως, πράγματα που ακόμα κι ως προπονητής δεν είναι εύκολο να το εξηγήσεις. Δεν υπάρχει εγχειρίδιο στο ποδόσφαιρο. Είναι απρόβλεπτο κάθε στιγμή. Σε ένα καλό επίπεδο ομάδων, κάθε τι μπορεί ν' αλλάξει την ψυχολογία. Δεν είναι εύκολο να το αλλάξεις. Εξαρτώνται πολλά από μία στιγμή. Στις Εθνικές πρέπει να είσαι πάντα προετοιμασμένος. Εκείς πιο έτοιμες είναι οι ομάδες που παίζουν συνέχεια μεγάλα ματς. Έχουν ίσως την ηρεμία να διαχειρίζονται δύσκολες καταστάσεις. Οι πιο δυνατοί αντίπαλοι θα σε κάνουν καλύτερο για τον επόμενο στόχο. Θέλουμε δεν θέλουμε, αφήσαμε το δεύτερο γκρουπ και σύντομα πήγαμε στο πρώτο γκρουπ. Αλλά τώρα θα είναι διαφορετικά στο Nations League».
Για το αν θα κάνει αλλαγές στον αυριανό αγώνα: «Δεν με απασχολεί το Σκωτία - Δανία, αλλά θα ήθελα να είμαι στη θέση τους, να παίζεται η πρόκριση. Με τη Σκωτία μετά το 3-0 υποφέραμε. Ήταν ένα από τα πιο απαιτητικά ματς. Αλλά θα γίνουν σίγουρα αλλαγές. Θα φρεσκάρουμε ορισμένα πράγματα. Αλλά να κάνω εδώ ένα μεγάλο rotation δεν είναι και πολύ χρήσιμο. Πρέπει να έχουμε μία ομάδα που θα έχει αλλαγές, κόντρα σε έναν αντίπαλο που βελτιώθηκε στα δύο τελευταία της παιχνίδια, ενώ είναι και οι συνθήκες με το άδειο γήπεδο».

Title       : Το παρασκήνιο πίσω από την άδεια αίθουσα Τύπου σε Μαρτίνεθ και Αταμάν!

--- Summary ---
Το Gazzetta έψαξε το θέμα που πήρε διαστάσεις από την στάση του προπονητή της Βαλένθια και το οποίο συνέχισε ο Τούρκος τεχνικός του Παναθηναϊκού κι έχει τις απαντήσεις για την παντελή απουσία των δημοσιογράφων από την συνέντευξη Τύπου των δύο τελευταίων αγώνων της Παρί.

--- Full Text ---
Το ζήτημα προέκυψε από το video που έκανε τον γύρο του διαδικτύου και στο οποίο ο Πέδρο Μαρτίνεθ εμφανίζεται να κάνει μία απίστευτη δήλωση 2,5 δευτερολέπτων για το ματς με την πρωταθλήτρια Γαλλίας και στην συνέχεια να φεύγει εμφανώς ενοχλημένος.
Η σημαντική λεπτομέρεια του απίστευτου σκηνικού είναι ότι η αίθουσα είναι άδεια και παρ' ότι δεν υπάρχει κανένας εκπρόσωπος Τύπου, ο media officer της Παρί δεν φαίνεται να έχει μπει καν στην διαδικασία να τον ενημερώσει, ζητώντας του να καθυστερήσει την προσέλευσή του στον χώρο.
«Το σκορ ήταν 90-86!», δήλωσε ο 64χρονος Καταλανός τεχνικός της Βαλένθια, που λίγο νωρίτερα είχε χάσει ένα σχεδόν δικό της παιχνίδι, με σερί 0-11 στα τελευταία 154 δευτερόλεπτα (ήταν μπροστά με +15 στις αρχές του 2ου μέρους και με +7, 3 λεπτά πριν το τέλος) και όπως ήταν φυσικό δεν ήταν στα καλύτερά του.
Το συγκεκριμένο video, που έγινε viral, ενδεχομένως να έδωσε στον Εργκίν Αταμάν το ερέθισμα για το σχόλιο που έκανε περί μετεγγραφής δημοσιογράφων στην Γαλλία με σαφή αιχμή για την νέα λίγκα που ετοιμάζει το ΝΒΑ σε συνεργασία με την FIBA.
«Στην Ευρωλίγκα υπάρχουν πολλές μεταγραφές παικτών, πρέπει να σκεφτούν να κάνουν και μεταγραφές δημοσιογράφων. Πήγα στο Παρίσι και δεν υπήρχε ούτε ένας δημοσιογράφος στη συνέντευξη Τύπου. Δεν μου έχει ξανασυμβεί ποτέ. Το ίδιο συνέβη και με τον Πέδρο Μαρτίνεθ. Αν δεν υπάρχει ενδιαφέρον, πώς θα κάνετε δυνατή λίγκα στο ΝΒΑ Europe; Σε πόλεις όπως το Παρίσι, το Λονδίνο και το Μάντσεστερ. Αν δεν υπάρχει ενδιαφέρον σε αυτές τις πόλεις, πώς θα δημιουργηθεί δυνατή λίγκα; Πρώτα πρέπει να υπάρχει ενδιαφέρον και το ενδιαφέρον το βάζουν οι δημοσιογράφοι. Πρέπει να το σκεφτούν σοβαρά γιατί είναι μια πολύ επικίνδυνη κατάσταση για το ευρωπαϊκό μπάσκετ!», σχολίασε ο Τούρκος τεχνικός με αφορμή ό,τι συνέβη στην “Accor Arena”, που είναι η νέα ονομασία του πάλαι ποτέ ιστορικού “Palais de Bercy”.
Η σύνδεση των δύο σπάνιων – για τα δεδομένα της σύγχρονης αθλητικής δημοσιογραφίας στο επίπεδο της Euroleague – σε συνδυασμό με τις παραπάνω δηλώσεις του προπονητή του Παναθηναϊκού (μετά το ματς με τον Άρη), μας ώθησε να σκαλίσουμε λίγο την υπόθεση και να αλιεύσουμε σημαντικές λεπτομέρειες. Γιατί η αλήθεια είναι ότι τα λεγόμενα του Άταμαν δεν ήχησαν θετικά στα αυτιά των Γάλλων συναδέλφων...
Τι συνέβη, λοιπόν, κατ' αρχάς στο παιχνίδι της Παρί με την Παναθηναϊκό και οι ρεπόρτερ απουσίαζαν από την συνέντευξη Τύπου; Η αναμέτρηση διεξήχθη ανήμερα μίας αργίας (η 11η Νοέμβρη θεωρείται ως σημαντική ημερομηνία για το τέλος του 1ου Παγκοσμίου Πολέμου) και επρόκειτο για το τρίτο σερί εντός έδρας ματς της γαλλικής ομάδας μέσα σε πέντε μέρες για την Euroleague (κόντρα στην Μπάγερν) και το πρωτάθλημα (κόντρα στην Λιμόζ).
Τα γαλλικά μέσα δεν διαθέτουν τόσους πολλούς αθλητικούς συντάκτες (η “L' Equipe” είναι η μοναδική αθλητική εφημερίδα με εθνική κυκλοφορία) ώστε να καλύπτουν ένα ματς με δύο ή τρεις δημοσιογράφους και όπως ήταν φυσικό, μετά το τέλος του αγώνα, το πρώτο μέλημα όλων όσοι βρέθηκαν στο γήπεδο ήταν να μιλήσουν με τον Τι Τζέι Σορτς.
Ο πρώην Αμερικανός point-guard της γαλλικής ομάδας, περικυκλώθηκε στην μικτή ζώνη, όπου βρέθηκαν και όλοι οι απεσταλμένοι των ελληνικών media και οι δηλώσεις του πρέπει να διήρκεσαν πάνω από 15-20 λεπτά! Mε αποτέλεσμα όταν ο προπονητής της φιλοξενούμενης ομάδας (στην Euroleague μιλάει πάντα πρώτος), εν προκειμένω ο Εργκίν Αταμάν, να κάνει μία τυπική δήλωση (αρχίζει στο 15.20 του παραπάνω video) σε μηδενικό ακροατήριο.
Θα μπορούσε, βέβαια, να είχε υπάρξει μία συνεννόηση ανάμεσα στους δύο υπευθύνους Τύπου ώστε να αποφευχθεί το φιάσκο.
Το ίδιο ακριβώς σκηνικό συνέβη και στο επόμενο ματς απέναντι στην Βαλένθια, που ήταν το 4ο διαδοχικό εντός έδρας ματς των Παριζιάνων και διεξήχθη στην φυσική τους έδρα, την “Adidas Arena”.
Η βασική λεπτομέρεια έχει να κάνει με το γεγονός ότι το ματς συνέπεσε με την μάχη της Γαλλίας με την Ουκρανία στο “Stade de France” για τα προκριματικά του Μουντιάλ, καθώς επίσης και με την 10η επέτειο από τις τρομοκρατικές επιθέσεις στο 10ο και το 11ο διαμέρισμα της γαλλικής πρωτεύουσας και στο προάστιο Σεν Ντενί, όπου συνολικά έχασαν την ζωή τους 129 άνθρωποι...
Κοινώς, το ματς έγινε έγινε με σχεδόν μηδενική δημοσιογραφική κάλυψη... Ωστόσο η αδιαφορία του υπευθύνου Τύπου της Παρί, προκαλεί έντονα ερωτηματικά...

Published   : 2025-11-17T17:12:43.263Z

--- Summary ---
Manchester United are set to launch a basketball team as minority owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe explores other revenue streams.

--- Full Text ---
In September, United announced that they earned record financial revenue of £665.5m ($877m) last year despite the poor performance of the men's team. United finished the season in 15th, marking their worst ever Premier League campaign, and lost the Europa League final to league rivals Tottenham, meaning they wouldn't compete in European competition in the 2025/26 season.
However, last year saw United start their five-year front-of-shirt sponsorship deal with Snapdragon, which saw the Premier League giants post record commercial revenue of £333.3m ($439m). Matchday revenue was also a record £160.3m ($211m) in the year to June 30, 2025.
On the record financials, chief executive Omar Berrada said: "To have generated record revenues during such a challenging year for the club demonstrates the resilience which is a hallmark of Manchester United. As we settle into the 2025-26 season, we are working hard to improve the club in all areas."
The high revenue enabled the club to spend big to sign Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo, Benjamin Sesko and Senne Lammens despite a thoroughly underwhelming domestic campaign.
However, United aren't ready to rest on their financial laurels as Sir Jim explores other revenue streams. Basketball is among those the club are set to invest in according to Gianni Petrucci, the President of the Italian Basketball Federation.
Petrucci claims that United have agreed to participate in NBA Europe as the National Basketball Association seeks to capitalise on the growing popularity of the sport outside of America. The initiative will see a host of European cities, including Manchester, host at least 10 found franchises, with the Italian telling Corriere dello Sport: "It's a new league that will be good for the system, bringing resources and entertainment. The agreement also notes that registered clubs must participate in their respective domestic leagues.
"In a $50 billion (£37.9bn) market, European basketball has a commercial value of just $200 million (£152m). An NBA league is precisely the opportunity to increase competitiveness and expand the pool. If Manchester United, the most popular football team in the world, has already said yes, there must be a reason."
There are also believed to be plans for a team based in the capital of Italy, Rome, but the exact list of participants remains unclear. "There is no team from the capital in Serie A, but Rome will not be left out. There is a very concrete option linked to a wealthy entrepreneur," Petrucci added.

United supremo Sir Jim is looking to increase profitability and despite posting record revenues last year, the club continues to lose money. The INEOS CEO sought to cut costs shortly after becoming minority owner through controversial redundancies, and this has seen the United workforce cut from 1,100 to 700 employees over the last two years.
Wages were also cut by over £50m ($66m), though that was in part due to the club's failure to qualify for the Champions League. Yet despite the lack of success, United are still predicting turnover of at least £640m ($843m) to the end of June 2026.
"As we start to feel the benefits of our cost reduction programme, there is significant potential for improved financial performance, which will, in turn, support our overriding priority: success on the pitch," Berrada said earlier this year.
United are looking to extend their unbeaten run when they take on rivals Everton next Monday. Ruben Amorim has overseen a five-game unbeaten run, rescued by a late Matthijs de Ligt equaliser in a 2-2 draw at Tottenham just over a week ago.
In that time, United have won three and drawn twice, and went into the international break seventh in the table, level on points with defending champions Liverpool. After the welcome of Everton next week, United round out November with a testing trip to Crystal Palace.

The midfielder reminded the world of what he brings, taking a big step forward as the clock ticks towards next summer's big tournament

--- Full Text ---
CHESTER, Pa. - Gio Reyna insisted he didn’t remember what he shouted into the camera after scoring his early goal on Saturday against Paraguay in a 2-1 win for the USMNT. Later, he admitted he did - he just didn’t want to repeat it.
No matter. His celebration made it clear: he’s back
"I was just happy to score," Reyna said after scoring one and setting up another in the USMNT's 2-1 win. "Just happy to be back."
After all this time, Reyna offered reminders of the player he can still be. He delivered a big goal - something that has long been his calling card - and found ways to influence the game throughout. And he remained, as always, at the center of attention when he pulls on a USMNT shirt, for better or worse.
His teammates, though, insist this is a new version of Reyna - a bit smarter and a bit more mature. Whether this Reyna can help lead the USMNT into a World Cup is the lingering question. Even after his goal, the debates around him haven’t faded; if anything, they’ve only grown sharper.
"I feel really good," Reyna said. "I feel valued, feel important, feel ready to go. Obviously, when you feel better mentally, you can definitely play better on the field, too. So yeah, I'm definitely building up, but I feel great. I'm just happy, but I have to keep working now."

Title       : Neymar to continue Pele's legacy! Father of Santos star set to acquire rights to Brazil icon's brand on anniversary of 1,000th goal | Goal.com
Link        : https://www.goal.com/en/lists/neymar-father-santos-star-acquire-rights-brazil-icon-brand/blt06113d13203c0554
Published   : 2025-11-17T17:57:42.293Z

--- Summary ---
Neymar and his father are set to to acquire the Pele brand through their company NR Sports. Neymar returned to Santos at the start of January having left the Brazilian side for La Liga giants Barcelona in 2013, where he'd go on to win La Liga and the Champions League. And the Brazil star is prepared to continue Pele's legacy as the player and his father acquire the brand rights.

--- Full Text ---
Pele was on the Santos books between 1956 and 1974, where he excelled for the Brazilian powerhouse. Indeed, the Brazil icon scored 643 goals in 659 outings for Santos before spending three seasons with the New York Cosmos and ultimately retiring in 1977.
Pele is considered to be one of the best footballers of all time with Neymar and his father expected to continue his legacy when they announce a deal to acquire his brand rights later this week. According to UOL, an official agreement worth a reported €15.5m (£14m/$18m) is expected on Wednesday, November 19 to mark the anniversary of Pele's 1,000th career goal.
The Pele brand previously belonged to American company Sport 10 and relied primarily on appearances at events. However, the brand has been underutilised since Pele's tragic passing in 2022 at the age of 82 due to multiple organ failure, a complication of colon cancer, which was initially diagnosed in 2021.
As a result of the acquisition, NR Sports will be able to use Pele's image and name, license for merchandise, and acquire historical footage as they look to revive and globalise the image of the former Brazil star. Pele's family still attend Santos games, with Neymar recently paying to renovate the box still occupied by the former's loved ones at the Vila Belmiro, which includes new seats, a remodelled bathroom, glass paneling, and air conditioning.
Neymar has looked to continue his compatriot's legacy by adorning the famous number 10 shirt once worn by Pele for both Santos and Brazil. However, Neymar's return to Santos has been plagued by injuries, meaning the former Barcelona and PSG star has only made 13 league starts for the Peixe.
Santos are also enduring a difficult domestic season and they head into the final knockings of the 2025 Brasileirao just one point and one place above the relegation zone. They did, though, claim a 1-0 win over Palmeiras at the weekend as Benjamin Rollheiser netted in second half injury time to claim a priceless three points.

Neymar has also been issued an ultimatum by Brazil head coach Carlo Ancelotti. The Selecao were underwhelming in CONMEBOL qualifying as they booked their 2026 World Cup spot in a bid to land a record-extending sixth World Cup, and their first since 2002.
Earlier this month, Brazil boss Carlo Ancelotti said: "Neymar is on the list of players who can go to the World Cup. He has six months to make the final list."
The 33-year-old returned to the Brazil squad back in March having last featured for the national team in October 2023, when he suffered a knee injury in action against Uruguay. And Ancelotti has made it clear that any decision for Neymar to return to the Brazil squad will be down to his physical condition after years of setbacks and fitness issues.
"Neymar has recovered, but he needs to show performance. When the Brazilian league ends he'll have some vacation time, and then he must show his quality and physical condition again," the Italian added.One way for Neymar to maintain his fitness is to secure a January switch, with a transfer away from Santos mooted. Neymar's current deal runs until the end of the year, and Fabrizio Romano has hinted that the Brazilian trickster could be on the move again in the New Year.
"Neymar is trying to help, but don't forget that Neymar could eventually be available as a free agent from the beginning of January," Romano said. "So an interesting situation to follow because Neymar could consider a move in the January transfer window. Now Neymar wants to be 100 per cent focused on his priority, so to help Santos avoid relegation and to do his best for his club.
"In this moment Neymar is not having any advanced negotiation, but some calls have started to understand the situation of Neymar. When there is a player of his level available on the market, it is obviously an opportunity. Okay, maybe Neymar is not in the best physical condition now, Neymar is coming from an injury, he had several injuries recently. But now he’s back, he's fit, he’s trying to help Santos.
"He's trying to find his best condition, and so keep an eye on Neymar because he could be one of the names to watch for the January transfer window on a free transfer, and so that could be an interesting situation to follow."

Title       : 'Do what I'm telling you!' – Carlo Ancelotti berates Chelsea sensation Estevao during Brazil training session and issues clear ultimatum | Goal.com

Published   : 2025-11-17T18:34:30.523Z

--- Summary ---
Brazil starlet Estevao Willian has been warned by national team boss Carlo Ancelotti that he must follow instructions or risk losing his place, after the Chelsea sensation was berated in front of his team-mates during training. The teenager has shone for his country, but the former Real Madrid coach has now made it clear he will be ruthless if the winger persistently does his own thing.

--- Full Text ---
Estevao found out the hard way during the October international break that Carlo Ancelotti's calm exterior does not extend to moments where discipline and concentration are compromised. As Brazil prepared for a friendly against South Korea last month, reports claim the teenager repeatedly ignored instructions to aggressively press the full-back during a tactical exercise. After several warnings, Ancelotti stopped the session and delivered a fierce reprimand in front of the entire squad.
The Brazil boss allegedly shouted: "I only speak once. Either you do what I'm telling you, or you're out of the team," according to Globo Esporte. It was a clear message that the youngster's spectacular talent would not exempt him from rigorous standards within the Brazil national team setup.
The tough love had an immediate effect. Estevao responded by scoring twice in the subsequent 5-0 win, and since then has continued to impress in the famous yellow shirt of Brazil. Despite the stern warning, Ancelotti has made it clear he sees the 18-year-old as a major part of his long-term plans, provided that he fully commits to tactical discipline.
Ancelotti’s approach to elite talent management is rooted in experience, having guided generational stars such as Kaka and Vinicius Jr, he knows the dangers of early hype. Estevao, nicknamed Messinho in Brazil due to his flair and left-footed magic, has quickly become a fan favourite, but expectations continue to grow at a rapid pace. The Chelsea youngster already boasts 10 international caps and four goals despite his young age, and this is why Ancelotti is intent on keeping him grounded.
Brazil are undergoing a major transitional phase, and the veteran coach is determined to build a squad with tactical maturity at its core. Estevao's blend of dribbling brilliance and intense work-rate fits that vision perfectly, but only if he continues to embrace defensive responsibilities.
The winger has quickly shown he appreciates the guidance. He has embraced the challenge of adapting to a more complete role, adding pressing and ball recoveries to his already dangerous attacking game.

Every stern moment appears balanced with trust and encouragement, the hallmark of Ancelotti's man-management. The Italian's relationship with Estevao isn't just demanding - it has a personal touch that has won the teenager's admiration. The Brazil boss recently allowed him to briefly leave camp in Sao Paulo to take his driving test, even waiting outside to celebrate the moment he passed. Ancelotti then publicly announced the achievement at lunch, prompting laughter and applause from team-mates.
That balance has created the perfect conditions for Estevao to excel as he continues to deliver on the pitch, scoring the opener in a 2-0 win against Senegal at the Emirates Stadium last week. It was further validation that he belongs among the senior elite despite still being in the early stages of his European career.
The forward only arrived at Chelsea in the summer after Palmeiras agreed a deal worth around £29 million ($38m) the previous year. His early Premier League minutes have been carefully managed, but his form for club and country leaves little doubt that he is already operating at an elite level.
Estevao is expected to continue playing a key role as Brazil face Tunisia next in Lille, looking to build on Ancelotti's encouraging start of four wins in six matches. With each appearance, the teenager grows in confidence, while the coaching staff push him toward becoming a complete attacker capable of changing matches on demand. The next challenge will be consistency, both in performance and tactical discipline.
For Chelsea, his rapid rise is hugely encouraging. They believe he is a long-term cornerstone of their attack, and his international success only strengthens the feeling that they secured one of world football's brightest young talents.

The next Xbox Partner Preview showcase event will be broadcast this week, Microsoft has confirmed.
Tune in on Thursday, November 20 at 10am Pacific, 1pm Eastern, or 6pm UK time for another set of new announcements and trailers from Xbox partners, plus some additional Xbox Game Pass confirmations.
Games shown during the event will include the highly-anticipated James Bond game 007 First Light from Hitman developer IO Interactive, plus Arthurian fantasy adventure Tides of Annihilation. Reanimal, the new horror game from Light Nightmares creator Tarsier Studios, will also be shown off in new detail.
As ever, it's unlikely we'll hear any detail on Xbox's own first-party projects during the show, such as Halo, Fable or Forza: Motorsport 6 — so set your expectations accordingly.
It's been just over a year since Xbox's last Partner Preview event in October 2024, which featured Alan Wake 2 DLC The Lake House, Cronos: The New Dawn, Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii, and more.
Since then, we've seen an Xbox Developer Direct event in January 2025 which dropped new details of Ninja Gaiden 5, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, Doom: The Dark Ages and South of Midnight, and this summer's main Xbox Games Showcase which centered on The Outer Worlds 2, alongside a slew of other titles.
What else do you hope to see more of this week?

Title       : Borderlands 4 Hits a New Low Price, Including Switch 2 Preorders

--- Summary ---
Borderlands 4 for PS5, Xbox Series X, and even Switch 2 preorders, has dropped to a new low price at Amazon ahead of Black Friday

--- Full Text ---
Black Friday is creeping up on us. For those keeping an eye on the calendar, the big sale event kicks off next week on November 28, but there are already plenty of great deals to look through. This is especially true of video games, with select releases seeing some nice discounts so far. Borderlands 4 is among them at Amazon, as it's hit a new low price for PS5, Xbox Series X, and even preorders on Nintendo Switch 2.
Borderlands 4 Hits a New Low Price
According to price tracker camelcamelcamel, this is the lowest price yet for the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X versions of Borderlands 4. It's also a first-time price drop for the Switch 2 preorders, which is worth taking advantage of if you've been looking to own it for the handheld. It's worth keeping in mind that the Switch 2 version has been delayed indefinitely, but this will still secure you a copy for when it's ready.
We were big fans of Borderlands 4. In our 8/10 review, writer Travis Northup said it's "a badass open-world evolution of a wonderfully unhinged looter-shooter series that needed to try something new, and it largely nails the biggest swings it takes. Combat is slicker than ever thanks to exciting new movement options and some interesting enemy designs, and the entertaining story takes things in a fresh direction while still tying neatly into existing lore."
This deal is just the beginning. There's so much more to come as we get closer to Black Friday, especially when it comes to video game deals. Our breakdowns of what to expect from PS5 and Xbox's sales this year can help you plan ahead. Nintendo's already announced its Black Friday sale so you can see what they'll have up their sleeves as well.

Ubisoft has warned of falling company revenues and said it's seen that "many new games are struggling to stand out" as players turn away from traditional full-price releases.
Projects that would previously have stood out are now finding it tough to "achieve the sales they may once had had," Ubisoft wrote in a new UK financial filing (thanks, CityAM), which blames a wider change in taste among players.
Explaining that the "traditional 'full game model' of selling a single £50-60 [$65-$80] game to a consumer as a one-time purchase" was continuing to "become less ubiquitous", Ubisoft said players were now opting to spend their time and money in other ways, such as "subscription services, long-running Games As A Service titles, Free to Play Games and cloud streaming."
In a nutshell, Ubisoft continued, "consumers are playing fewer games." And while some one-off, full-price titles were continuing to be successful, these had become "a few notable exceptions" to the wider trend, it continued.
The remarks come amid a continued period of uncertainty for Ubisoft, which has suffered layoffs and a sizable corporate restructure in the past year. The Paris-headquartered company — whose biggest franchises are now operated by an independent subsidiary backed by Tencent — has struggled to find its next big hit after disappointing sales for Star Wars Outlaws and continued attempts to crack the increasingly-saturated live-service game market, such as with doomed shooter XDefiant, and the pre-emptively cancelled The Division: Heartland.
As for Assassin's Creed, the company has gone all-in on its biggest brand — though was forced to slow its production line of upcoming games and remakes to give this year's Assassin's Creed Shadows more time. Still, a slew of upcoming other titles in the franchise are expected over the next few years (including the witchcraft-focused Hexe, a multiplayer spin-off, and a long-awaited Black Flag remake).
Last week, Ubisoft dramatically halted trading of its company shares and postponed the wider firm's latest financial report mere minutes before a scheduled shareholder call was due to go live. Days later, Ubisoft is yet to provide more context for the move, as fans of its games — and the vast majority of its staff — wait to hear more.

Title       : 'Fake News': Resident Evil Requiem Developers Dismiss Much-Discussed Fan Image of Leon With an Eyepatch

--- Full Text ---
Resident Evil Requiem's producer has attempted to address the persistent speculation that fan-favorite character Leon S. Kennedy will appear in the game, by branding a particular image as "fake news."
Capcom continues to promote the upcoming Resident Evil Requiem as a new entry in the series starring fresh protagonist Grace Ashcroft, though has never explicitly stated that she is the sole playable character.
Indeed, when IGN sat down with Capcom at Gamescom 2025 in August, we were told that its staff members would not discuss any internet rumors of certain other characters appearing. But now, in an interview with Stevivor, producer Masato Kumazawa has at least acknowleged the ongoing speculation — and confirmed one particular image is a fan creation.
Resident Evil fans have recently been debating the veracity of an image shared widely on social media that features an older Leon with an eyepatch. Many had suggested the picture was likely AI-generated, and now, addressing this image specifically, Kumazawa has described it as "fake news."
"Apart from any official information that Capcom has released, the rest is more [fan] detective work," Kumazawa said. "So I would suggest to please not take everything at face value. Considering that now is the time when AI [can be used to make] videos and photos, we don't know what's right or what's wrong.
"Players are free to believe what they would like to believe," he continued, "what I'd like to tell is that, please, unless it's officially released from Capcom, we can't give you any confirmation."
Another recent source of discussion among Resident Evil fans is the labelling of DLC costumes for Grace Ashcroft found within the game's deluxe edition. This pricier package advertises the fact it contains five additional costumes total, though only a couple for Grace have so far been showcased. As well as that, each in-game item is labelled with the "Grace's Costume:" prefix, something fans have excitedly suggested means that more costumes for other characters (Leon) are being held back.
"There has been a photo lately of Leon with an eyepatch, and just basically saying there's a DLC or a new costume for Leon," Kumazawa stated, "but just to make sure, these are all fake news."
Once again, however, Capcom appears to have stopped short of saying Leon isn't in the game — and at this point, if he wasn't, you'd think its developers would want to set the record straight in order to start managing expectations.
Resident Evil Requiem launches on February 27, 2026 for PC, PlayStation 5, Switch 2 and Xbox Series X/S — whether it includes Leon or not.

--- Full Text ---
Στους διαδρόμους της διεθνούς τραπεζικής, όπου μια φράση αρκεί για να μετακινήσει κεφάλαια δισεκατομμυρίων, ένα σενάριο παίρνει πλέον πραγματικές διαστάσεις: η UBS, το διαμάντι του ελβετικού χρηματοπιστωτικού τομέα, εξετάζει για πρώτη φορά σοβαρά την ιδέα να μεταφέρει την έδρα της στις ΗΠΑ .
Και οι μυστικές συνομιλίες του προέδρου της με την Ουάσινγκτον επιβεβαιώνουν ότι η πίεση στην Ελβετία κορυφώνεται.
Ο πρόεδρος της UBS, Κολμ Κέλεχερ, είχε κατ’ ιδίαν συζητήσεις με τον υπουργό Οικονομικών των ΗΠΑ, Σκοτ Μπέσεντ, σχετικά με το ενδεχόμενο μεταφοράς της έδρας της τράπεζας στις ΗΠΑ.
Η τράπεζα εξετάζει εναλλακτικά σχέδια έκτακτης ανάγκης, σε περίπτωση που η ελβετική κυβέρνηση δεν υπαναχωρήσει από τους νέους κανόνες κεφαλαιακής επάρκειας.
Οι επαφές συνεχίστηκαν τους τελευταίους μήνες, με την κυβέρνηση Τραμπ να δείχνει διάθεση να υποδεχθεί ένα από τα σημαντικότερα χρηματοοικονομικά ιδρύματα της Ελβετίας, σύμφωνα με τρεις πηγές των Financial Times.
Οι επαφές με τον Μπέσεντ αποτελούν μέρος της προσπάθειας του Κέλεχερ να ασκήσει πίεση κατά των προτεινόμενων ελβετικών κεφαλαιακών απαιτήσεων, που θα υποχρέωναν την UBS να διατηρεί επιπλέον 26 δισ. δολάρια κεφαλαίου—μια κίνηση που η τράπεζα χαρακτηρίζει «ακραία» και δυσανάλογη.
Η αβεβαιότητα γύρω από τις αλλαγές έχει επηρεάσει αρνητικά την τιμή της μετοχής της UBS, ενώ οι δημόσιες και ιδιωτικές παρεμβάσεις της διοίκησης έχουν μέχρι σήμερα αποφέρει ελάχιστα.
Η UBS επισημαίνει ότι οι νέες απαιτήσεις υπερβαίνουν κατά πολύ τα αντίστοιχα διεθνή πρότυπα, περιορίζοντας τη δυνατότητά της να ανταγωνίζεται παγκοσμίως.
Η ελβετική κυβέρνηση υποστηρίζει ότι χρειάζεται να ενισχύσει τη σταθερότητα του τραπεζικού συστήματος ώστε να αποφευχθεί μια νέα κρίση τύπου Credit Suisse. Η UBS είχε αποκτήσει τον άλλοτε βασικό της ανταγωνιστή το 2023 σε κρατικά ενορχηστρωμένη διάσωση.
«Θέλουμε να συνεχίσουμε να λειτουργούμε επιτυχώς ως παγκόσμια τράπεζα από την Ελβετία», σχολίασε η UBS.
Οι ρυθμιστικές αρχές των ΗΠΑ υπήρξαν παραδοσιακά επιφυλακτικές απέναντι στην εγκατάσταση μεγάλων τραπεζών στη χώρα λόγω του ιστορικού των διασώσεων της χρηματοπιστωτικής κρίσης.
Παρόλα αυτά, η κυβέρνηση Τραμπ έχει δείξει μεγαλύτερη διάθεση προσέλκυσης ευρωπαϊκών χρηματοπιστωτικών ομίλων.
Στελέχη της UBS επιθυμούν η έδρα να παραμείνει στην Ελβετία, εφόσον το κοινοβούλιο περιορίσει τις επιπτώσεις των προτεινόμενων μέτρων. Ωστόσο, αναγνωρίζουν –όπως αναφέρουν πηγές στους FT– ότι έχουν καθήκον να εξετάσουν όλες τις πιθανές επιλογές, συμπεριλαμβανομένης και της αποχώρησης.
Ο ακτιβιστής επενδυτής Cevian Capital, ένας από τους σημαντικούς μετόχους της UBS, προειδοποίησε ότι οι νέοι κανόνες θα καθιστούσαν «μη βιώσιμη» τη λειτουργία μιας μεγάλης διεθνούς τράπεζας με έδρα την Ελβετία. Κατά τον Cevian, η UBS «δεν θα έχει άλλη ρεαλιστική επιλογή» αν δεν αλλάξουν οι προτάσεις.
Την ίδια στιγμή, οι ΗΠΑ προωθούν την απελευθέρωση των τραπεζικών κανόνων με στόχο την ανάπτυξη και την ενίσχυση της ιδιωτικής πίστωσης. Η αμερικανική κυβέρνηση έχει δηλώσει την πρόθεση να χαλαρώσει τους κανόνες κεφαλαίου και ρευστότητας, γεγονός που προκαλεί ανησυχία σε ευρωπαϊκές αρχές ότι οι Αμερικανοί δανειστές θα αποκτήσουν ανταγωνιστικό πλεονέκτημα, αυξάνοντας παράλληλα τους κινδύνους για τη διεθνή χρηματοπιστωτική σταθερότητα.
Ελβετοί ομολογιούχοι αναζητούν τρόπους πίεσης για συμβιβασμό με την UBS μετά την απροσδόκητη απόφαση του Ελβετικού Ομοσπονδιακού Διοικητικού Δικαστηρίου, το οποίο έκρινε ότι η διαγραφή ομολόγων αξίας 16,5 δισ. ελβετικών φράγκων της Credit Suisse δεν είχε επαρκή νομική βάση.
Η Finma και η UBS έχουν ασκήσει έφεση, με την υπόθεση να παραπέμπεται στο Ανώτατο Δικαστήριο. Η διαδικασία αναμένεται να διαρκέσει χρόνια, ενώ η απόφαση δεν θα εκτελεστεί όσο εκκρεμεί η έφεση.

--- Full Text ---
Οι δηλώσεις της βουλευτή του ΠΑΣΟΚ, Ράνιας Θρασκιά, η οποία ανέφερε ότι το κόμμα της αξιωματικής αντιπολίτευσης είναι «ανοιχτό σε διάλογο ακόμη και με τον Τσίπρα », άναψαν «φωτιές» στο πολιτικό σκηνικό, μετά το δηκτικό σχόλιο του κυβερνητικού εκπροσώπου, στο οποίο απάντησε αναλόγως η Χαριλάου Τρικούπη.
Ειδικότερα, η Ράνια Θρασκιά, μιλώντας στον ΣΚΑΪ, ρωτήθηκε αν θα διαβάσει το βιβλίο του Αλέξη Τσίπρα και, αφού απάντησε καταφατικά, σημείωσε μεταξύ άλλων πως το ΠΑΣΟΚ δεν νιώθει να απειλείται από τον πρώην πρωθυπουργό.
«Όχι, δεν νιώθουμε ότι μας απειλεί ο κ. Τσίπρας στο ΠΑΣΟΚ. Αυτό που μας απειλεί ως χώρα είναι οι πολιτικές της Νέας Δημοκρατίας. Αυτές που ενώ οι αριθμοί ευημερούν, οι πολίτες δυστυχούν, σε πολλά επίπεδα», επισήμανε, προσθέτοντας χαρακτηριστικά: «Θεωρώ και ελπίζω πως ό,τι υπάρχει στη χώρα και εκφράζει τον προοδευτικό κόσμο πρέπει να συσπειρωθεί με επικεφαλής το ΠΑΣΟΚ- Κίνημα Αλλαγής ακόμα και με τον κ. Τσίπρα, γιατί είμαστε ανοιχτοί σε αυτό τον διάλογο. Οποιοσδήποτε κάθεται κάτω από το κυβερνητικό πρόγραμμα του ΠΑΣΟΚ, που είναι κοστολογημένο σε όλα τα μεγάλα προβλήματα της χώρας, είναι ένας συνομιλητής μας, αλλά με επικεφαλής το ΠΑΣΟΚ του Νίκου Ανδρουλάκη», ξεκαθάρισε ωστόσο.
Από την πλευρά του, ο Παύλος Μαρινάκης έσπευσε να ρωτήσει «πώς νιώθουν στο κόμμα της αξιωματικής αντιπολίτευσης όσοι κράτησαν, πριν από 10 χρόνια, μαζί με τους βουλευτές της ΝΔ, την Ελλάδα στην Ευρώπη, όταν ακούν από ‘συντρόφους’ τους ότι εκείνος που τους κουνούσε τότε το δάχτυλο αποτελεί εν δυνάμει εταίρο τους;».
Ο κυβερνητικός εκπρόσωπος τόνισε πως η βουλευτήε του ΠΑΣΟΚ Ράνια Θρασκιά κατέστησε εν δυνάμει συνομιλητή του κόμματος της αξιωματικής αντιπολίτευσης τον Αλέξη Τσίπρα, ενώ προσέθεσε πως «αντίστοιχες δηλώσεις έχουμε ακούσει και από άλλα στελέχη του ΠΑΣΟΚ του κ. Ανδρουλάκη, ως συνέχεια της επιλογής της ηγεσίας του κόμματος να συνταχθεί τους προηγούμενους μήνες, σε μία σειρά ζητημάτων, όχι μόνο με τον ΣΥΡΙΖΑ, αλλά και με κομματίδια που προήλθαν από αυτό τον χώρο, υιοθετώντας κάποιες φορές ακόμα και την ακραία ρητορική τους».
Τέλος, ο κ. Μαρινάκης αναρωτήθηκε αν όλοι στο ΠΑΣΟΚ είναι σύμφωνοι με αυτές τις δηλώσεις, τη στιγμή που στελέχη του στοχοποιήθηκαν από τα «παρα-υπουργεία δικαιοσύνης» του κ. Τσίπρα και «κρεμάστηκαν στα μανταλάκια».
Άμεση ήταν η απάντση του ΠΑΣΟΚ, το οποίο σχολίασε δηκτικά πως «ο κ. Μαρινάκης επέλεξε να μείνει σιωπηλός την επομένη της συζήτησης στη Βουλή για την ακρίβεια, όπου ο πρωθυπουργός έδειξε την τεράστια απόστασή του από τις κοινωνικές ανάγκες, φέρνοντας ως δικαιολογία για το ράλι ακρίβειας, την καρτελοποίηση της αγοράς, το δυσθεώρητο κόστος διαβίωσης και την καταρράκωση της αγοραστικής δύναμης των πολιτών, το αμίμητο επιχείρημα ‘δεν είμαι ο Χάρι Πότερ’».
Για να τονίσει χαρακτηριστικά: «Με την έναρξη της εβδομάδας ο κυβερνητικός εκπρόσωπος έδειξε την ατζέντα της κυβέρνησης: Τσιπρολογία και άγιος ο Θεός!».
«Γιατί στο σκεπτικό του Μαξίμου ‘με μια Ιθάκη… ξεχνιέσαι’. Πού να συζητάμε τώρα για τα καθημερινά προβλήματα, τα σκάνδαλα, το μνημόνιο στον πρωτογενή τομέα κ.ο.κ.», προσέθεσε η Χαριλάου Τρικούπη, δίχως να παραλείψει να αναφερθεί στο βιβλίο του Αλέξη Τσίπρα.
«Αυταπατάται όμως η κυβέρνηση της Νέας Δημοκρατίας, αν νομίζει ότι θα αλλάξει τη δημόσια ατζέντα. Οι πολίτες έπαθαν και έμαθαν και από τον κ. Τσίπρα και από τον κ. Μητσοτάκη. Μια από τα ίδια ισοδυναμεί με καθήλωση της χώρας και της ζωής τους», τόνισε καταληκτικά.

--- Full Text ---
Τα τέσσερα βασικά μηνύματα από τις φθινοπωρινές οικονομικές προβλέψεις της Ευρωπαϊκής Επιτροπής για την οικονομία της ΕΕ, αναδεικνύει στις δηλώσεις του ο σημερινός εκτελεστικός αντιπρόεδρος της Κομισιόν Βάλντις Ντομπρόβσκις, σχολιάζοντας τη σχετική έκθεση που δόθηκε σήμερα στη δημοσιότητα:
Πρώτον, στην ανάπτυξη: Η οικονομία της ΕΕ ξεπέρασε τις προσδοκίες τους πρώτους εννέα μήνες του τρέχοντος έτους. Κοιτώντας πιο μακριά στο μέλλον, εκτιμάται ότι η ανάπτυξη θα συνεχιστεί με μέτριο ρυθμό, παρά το δύσκολο εξωτερικό περιβάλλον.
Δεύτερον, στον πληθωρισμό: Ο πληθωρισμός αναμένεται να κυμανθεί γύρω από τον στόχο του 2% στη ζώνη του ευρώ και μόνο ελαφρώς υψηλότερος στην ΕΕ, κατά τον χρονικό ορίζοντα των προβλέψεων. Η διαρκής επιστροφή σε σταθερές τιμές είναι καλά νέα για τους Ευρωπαίους καταναλωτές, οι οποίοι έχουν δει την αγοραστική τους δύναμη να διαβρώνεται από τον πληθωρισμό τα τελευταία χρόνια.
Τρίτον, στα δημόσια οικονομικά: Η συνολική δημοσιονομική κατάσταση έχει βελτιωθεί σημαντικά από την πανδημία COVID-19. Ωστόσο, αναμένονται λιγότερο θετικές εξελίξεις τα επόμενα χρόνια, με τους λόγους χρέους και ελλείμματος να αυξάνονται απότομα. Αυτό ισχύει ιδιαίτερα σε ορισμένα κράτη μέλη.
Τέταρτον, και ίσως το πιο σημαντικό, σχετικά με την αβεβαιότητα: Αυτή η πρόβλεψη επισκιάζεται από σημαντική αβεβαιότητα και ο δρόμος μπροστά είναι γεμάτος πιθανές παγίδες. Αν κάτι είναι βέβαιο, είναι ότι η αβεβαιότητα θα παραμείνει ένα καθοριστικό χαρακτηριστικό των επόμενων ετών.
Ο κ. Ντομπρόβσκις υπογραμμίζει επίσης ότι «εξετάζοντας τη δημοσιονομική θέση των κρατών μελών με περισσότερες λεπτομέρειες, βλέπουμε ότι έντεκα αναμένεται να έχουν ελλείμματα που υπερβαίνουν το 3% του ΑΕΠ το 2025». Αυτές είναι: Βέλγιο, Γερμανία, Γαλλία, Λετονία, Μάλτα, Αυστρία, Σλοβακία, Φινλανδία, Ουγγαρία, Πολωνία, Ρουμανία. Στην Ιταλία, το έλλειμμα προβλέπεται να μειωθεί στο 3% του ΑΕΠ φέτος και να μειωθεί περαιτέρω τα επόμενα χρόνια.
Οι φθινοπωρινές οικονομικές προβλέψεις της Ευρωπαϊκής Επιτροπής για το 2025 δείχνουν ότι η ανάπτυξη κατά τα τρία πρώτα τρίμηνα του 2025 υπερέβη τις προσδοκίες. Ενώ οι υψηλές επιδόσεις οφείλονταν αρχικά στην αύξηση των εξαγωγών εν αναμονή των αυξήσεων των δασμών, η οικονομία της ΕΕ συνέχισε να αναπτύσσεται το τρίτο τρίμηνο. Όσον αφορά τις μελλοντικές εξελίξεις, η οικονομική δραστηριότητα αναμένεται να συνεχίσει να επεκτείνεται με μέτριο ρυθμό στη διάρκεια του χρονικού ορίζοντα των προβλέψεων, παρά το δύσκολο εξωτερικό περιβάλλον.
Οι φετινές φθινοπωρινές προβλέψεις προβλέπουν αύξηση του πραγματικού ΑΕΠ κατά 1,4 % στην ΕΕ το 2025 και το 2026, με αύξηση έως και 1,5 % το 2027. Η ζώνη του ευρώ αναμένεται να αντικατοπτρίζει αυτή την τάση, καθώς το πραγματικό ΑΕΠ προβλέπεται να αυξηθεί κατά 1,3 % το 2025, 1,2 % το 2026 και 1,4 % το 2027. Ο πληθωρισμός στη ζώνη του ευρώ προβλέπεται να συνεχίσει να μειώνεται, φθάνοντας στο 2,1% το 2025, και να κυμανθεί γύρω στο 2% κατά τη διάρκεια του χρονικού ορίζοντα των προβλέψεων. Στην ΕΕ, ο πληθωρισμός αναμένεται να παραμείνει οριακά υψηλότερος και να μειωθεί στο 2,2 % το 2027.
Οι πιο πρόσφατοι επιχειρηματικοί δείκτες και τα στοιχεία ερευνών υποδηλώνουν σταθερή θετική δυναμική τα επόμενα τρίμηνα. Πιο μακροπρόθεσμα, το παγκόσμιο περιβάλλον εξακολουθεί να αποτελεί πρόκληση, αλλά μια ανθεκτική αγορά εργασίας, η βελτίωση της αγοραστικής δύναμης και οι ευνοϊκές συνθήκες χρηματοδότησης αναμένεται να στηρίξουν τη συγκρατημένη οικονομική ανάπτυξη.
Επιπλέον, ο μηχανισμός ανάκαμψης και ανθεκτικότητας και άλλα ταμεία της ΕΕ αμβλύνουν τις επιπτώσεις της δημοσιονομικής εξυγίανσης σε αρκετά κράτη μέλη. Η στήριξη αυτή στηρίζει την εγχώρια ζήτηση, η οποία αναμένεται να αποτελέσει τον κύριο μοχλό ανάπτυξης κατά τη διάρκεια του χρονικού ορίζοντα των προβλέψεων. Η ιδιωτική κατανάλωση αναμένεται να αυξηθεί σταθερά, υποβοηθούμενη από τους παραπάνω παράγοντες, αλλά και από τη σταδιακή μείωση του ρυθμού αποταμίευσης. Οι επενδύσεις αναμένεται να ανακτήσουν τη δυναμική τους, κυρίως λόγω των μη οικιστικών κατασκευών και των κεφαλαιουχικών δαπανών για εξοπλισμό.
Η εξαιρετικά ανοικτή οικονομία της ΕΕ παραμένει ευάλωτη στους συνεχιζόμενους εμπορικούς περιορισμούς, αλλά οι εμπορικές συμφωνίες που επιτεύχθηκαν μεταξύ των ΗΠΑ και των εμπορικών εταίρων τους, συμπεριλαμβανομένης της ΕΕ, έχουν μετριάσει ορισμένες από τις αβεβαιότητες που επισκίασαν τις εαρινές προβλέψεις.
Ο πληθωρισμός στη ζώνη του ευρώ αναθεωρήθηκε ελαφρώς προς τα άνω σε σχέση με τις εαρινές προβλέψεις
Σύμφωνα με τις προβλέψεις, όλοι οι ειδικοί ανά χώρα και τομέα δασμοί που εφάρμοσε η κυβέρνηση των ΗΠΑ κατά την καταληκτική ημερομηνία της 31ης Οκτωβρίου θα ισχύουν καθ’ όλη τη διάρκεια του χρονικού ορίζοντα των προβλέψεων. Σε παγκόσμιο επίπεδο, οι εμπορικοί φραγμοί έχουν φθάσει σε ιστορικά υψηλά επίπεδα και η ΕΕ αντιμετωπίζει πλέον υψηλότερους μέσους δασμούς στις εξαγωγές προς τις ΗΠΑ από ό,τι αναμενόταν στις εαρινές προβλέψεις του 2025. Ωστόσο, οι δασμοί στις εξαγωγές της ΕΕ παραμένουν χαμηλότεροι από εκείνους που εφαρμόζονται σε αρκετούς άλλους σημαντικούς παγκόσμιους παράγοντες. Αυτό αντιπροσωπεύει ένα μέτριο σχετικό πλεονέκτημα για την οικονομία της ΕΕ, αν και σε ένα πλαίσιο ασθενούς παγκόσμιου εμπορίου αγαθών και ισχυρής μείωσης της εξωτερικής ζήτησης λόγω του ευρώ.
Ο πληθωρισμός στη ζώνη του ευρώ αναθεωρήθηκε ελαφρώς προς τα άνω σε σχέση με τις εαρινές προβλέψεις. Αναμένεται τώρα να μειωθεί από 2,4 % το 2024 για να επιτευχθεί ο στόχος της ΕΚΤ για 2 % το 2027. Οι τάσεις ποικίλλουν μεταξύ των συνιστωσών, με τις μειώσεις του πληθωρισμού των υπηρεσιών και των ειδών διατροφής να αντισταθμίζονται από την αύξηση του πληθωρισμού της ενέργειας. Η όξυνση των ανταγωνιστικών πιέσεων από τις εισαγωγές και η ανατίμηση του ευρώ αναμένεται να περιορίσουν τον πληθωρισμό των μη ενεργειακών αγαθών. Ο ονομαστικός πληθωρισμός στην ΕΕ προβλέπεται να είναι οριακά υψηλότερος από ό,τι στη ζώνη του ευρώ, υποχωρώντας σταδιακά από 2,6 % το 2024 σε 2,2 % το 2027. Η πρόβλεψη αυτή βασίζεται στην παραδοχή ότι το νέο σύστημα εμπορίας εκπομπών της ΕΕ (ΣΕΔΕ2) θα τεθεί σε ισχύ το 2027, όπως έχει νομοθετηθεί.
Η σταδιακή επιβράδυνση της αύξησης της απασχόλησης που ξεκίνησε το 2022 συνεχίστηκε το πρώτο εξάμηνο του 2025. Ωστόσο, η οικονομία της ΕΕ δημιούργησε 380.000 θέσεις εργασίας κατά τη διάρκεια αυτής της περιόδου. Η απασχόληση αναμένεται να συνεχίσει να αυξάνεται συγκρατημένα —κατά 0,5 % το 2025 και το 2026— προτού επιβραδυνθεί σε 0,4 % το 2027. Το ποσοστό ανεργίας αναμένεται να μειωθεί περαιτέρω από 5,9 % το 2025 και το 2026 σε 5,8 % το 2027. Η αύξηση των μισθών στην ΕΕ αναμένεται να επιβραδυνθεί, αλλά να παραμείνει πάνω από τον πληθωρισμό, βελτιώνοντας ελαφρώς την αγοραστική δύναμη των νοικοκυριών.
Το έλλειμμα της γενικής κυβέρνησης της ΕΕ αναμένεται να αυξηθεί από 3,1 % του ΑΕΠ το 2024 σε 3,4 % έως το 2027, εν μέρει λόγω της αύξησης των αμυντικών δαπανών από 1,5 % του ΑΕΠ το 2024 σε 2 % το 2027, μετρούμενο σύμφωνα με την ταξινόμηση των κρατικών λειτουργιών (COFOG).
Ο δείκτης χρέους της ΕΕ ως προς το ΑΕΠ προβλέπεται να αυξηθεί από 84,5 % το 2024 σε 85 % το 2027, ενώ ο δείκτης της ζώνης του ευρώ αναμένεται να αυξηθεί από περίπου 88 % σε 90,4 %. Αυτό αντανακλά τα συνεχιζόμενα πρωτογενή ελλείμματα και το γεγονός ότι το μέσο κόστος του δημόσιου χρέους είναι υψηλότερο από την αύξηση του ονομαστικού ΑΕΠ. Έως το 2027, τέσσερα κράτη μέλη αναμένεται να έχουν δείκτες χρέους άνω του 100 % του ΑΕΠ.
Όσον αφορά το μέλλον, οι κίνδυνοι για τις προοπτικές ανάπτυξης κλίνουν προς τα κάτω.
Η συνεχιζόμενη αβεβαιότητα όσον αφορά την εμπορική πολιτική εξακολουθεί να επιβαρύνει την οικονομική δραστηριότητα, καθώς οι δασμοί και οι μη δασμολογικοί περιορισμοί ενδέχεται να περιορίσουν την ανάπτυξη της ΕΕ περισσότερο από ό,τι αναμενόταν.
Οποιαδήποτε περαιτέρω κλιμάκωση των γεωπολιτικών εντάσεων θα μπορούσε να εντείνει τους κλυδωνισμούς στην προσφορά. Ταυτόχρονα, η ανατιμολόγηση των κινδύνων στις αγορές μετοχών, ιδίως στον τεχνολογικό τομέα των ΗΠΑ, θα μπορούσε να επηρεάσει την εμπιστοσύνη των επενδυτών και τις συνθήκες χρηματοδότησης. Η εσωτερική πολιτική αβεβαιότητα μπορεί επίσης να επηρεάσει αρνητικά την εμπιστοσύνη. Τέλος, η αυξανόμενη συχνότητα των καταστροφών που σχετίζονται με το κλίμα θα μπορούσε να υπονομεύσει την ανάπτυξη.
Από την άλλη πλευρά, η αποφασιστική πρόοδος όσον αφορά τις μεταρρυθμίσεις και το θεματολόγιο για την ανταγωνιστικότητα, οι υψηλότερες αμυντικές δαπάνες που επικεντρώνονται στην παραγωγή της ΕΕ και οι νέες εμπορικές συμφωνίες θα μπορούσαν να ενισχύσουν την οικονομική δραστηριότητα περισσότερο από ό,τι προβλέπεται.

--- Full Text ---
Ένα από τα «αγαπημένα» επιχειρήματα των αναθεωρητών της Ιστορίας και εκείνων που επιχειρούν διαχρονικά να αναδείξουν «μύθους» και να μειώσουν τη σημασία της εξέγερσης του Πολυτεχνείου, είναι εκείνο που λέει ότι δεν ήταν αυτό που έριξε τη Χούντα των Συνταγματαρχών.
Είναι απορίας άξιον το συγκεκριμένο επιχείρημα καθώς ουδείς από τους πρωταγωνιστές εκείνων των ημερών από την πλευρά των φοιτητών έχει υποστηρίξει κάτι τέτοιο. Αυτό όμως που λένε και το οποίο έχει βάση είναι το πως τα γεγονότα του Πολυτεχνείου αποτέλεσαν τη θρυαλλίδα των εξελίξεων που λίγους μήνες αργότερα θα οδηγήσουν στην πτώση της Χούντας.
Χαρακτηριστικό φιλοχουντικό αφήγημα είναι τα όσα γράφει στο βιβλίο του ο στενός συνεργάτης του δικτάτορα Παπαδόπουλου, Κωνσταντίνος Πλεύρης, πατέρας του σημερινού υπουργού Μετανάστευσης. Ειδικότερα, στο πόνημά του «Γεγονότα 1965-1977-Τα άγνωστα παρασκήνια» – εκδ. Ήλεκτρον, αφενός υποστηρίζει ότι η εξέγερση του Πολυτεχνείου ήταν χρηματοδοτούμενη από την…CIA, αφετέρου αρνείται ότι υπάρχουν νεκροί.
Κερασάκι στην τούρτα είναι τα όσα λέει σχετικά με τη σημασία της εξέγερσης την οποία και επιχειρεί να υποβαθμίσει. Σύμφωνα με τον ίδιο δεν υπήρχε πτώση καμίας Χούντας από το Πολυτεχνείο καθώς εκείνη την περίοδο η χώρα βάδιζε προς «δημοκρατικάς εκλογάς», τις οποίες το Πολυτεχνείο… εμπόδισε, καθώς λίγες μέρες αργότερα από τα γεγονότα, ο Ιωαννίδης ανέτρεψε πραξικοπηματικά τον Παπαδόπουλο.
Εννοείται πως κομμάτια της εν λόγω επιχειρηματολογίας έχουν υιοθετήσει τα τελευταία χρόνια και άλλα στελέχη της Δεξιάς και της Άκρας Δεξιάς όπως ο κ. Γεωργιάδης, ο κ. Βορίδης, η κα Λατινοπούλου κ.α.
Για κακή τους τύχη όμως, τη σημασία της εξέγερσης του Πολυτεχνείου πρώτος και καλύτερος αναγνώρισε ένας ακραιφνής Δεξιός της εποχής εκείνης, ο Ευάγγελος Αβέρωφ. Σε υπόμνημά του προς τον Χουντικό πρόεδρο, στρατηγό Γκιζίκη, τον Ιανουάριο του 1974, αναφέρει χαρακτηριστικά: «Αν σήμερα συμβή ένα επεισόδιον όπως εκείνο του Πολυτεχνείου, ή άλλο ανάλογον, δεν θα βοηθήσουν 15.000 άτομα αλλά 150.000 άτομα, και έπειτα από ολίγους μήνας 500.000 άτομα διαφόρων προελεύσεων και στάσεων».
Η αλήθεια είναι ότι από τα γεγονότα του Πολυτεχνείου και μετά αποδεικνύεται ότι η Χούντα δεν είναι τόσο ισχυρή όσο πολλοί πίστευαν ότι είναι. Τα γεγονότα προκαλούν διεθνή κατακραυγή την οποία οι Συνταγματάρχες δεν μπορούν ούτε να χειριστούν, πόσο μάλλον να ελέγξουν.
Εξόχως σημαντικό είναι επίσης το γεγονός ότι τα γεγονότα του Πολυτεχνείου και τα όσα ακολούθησαν ακύρωσαν ουσιαστικά το «Σύνταγμα« του 1973, που ήταν εντελώς χουντικής νοοτροπίας και επιχειρούσε να εμφανιστεί ως «φιλελεύθερο», πετώντας ως «τυράκι»τη διεξαγωγή εκλογών.
Υπενθυμίζεται ότι το εν λόγω «Σύνταγμα« μεταξύ άλλων προέβλεπε την κατάργηση της βασιλείας και τη θέσπιση ως ανώτατου άρχοντα, του Προέδρου της Δημοκρατίας, θέση που είχε ήδη καπαρώσει ο Παπαδόπουλος.
Όπως αναφέρει χαρακτηριστικά σε σχετικό του κείμενο ο  Διδάκτορας της Νομικής Σχολής του Αριστοτέλειου Πανεπιστημίου Θεσσαλονίκης, Χαράλαμπος Κουρουνδής, «σύμφωνα με το νέο «Σύνταγμα», ο Πρόεδρος της Δημοκρατίας, «ανώτατος άρχων του κράτους, σύμβολον της ενότητος του έθνους», εκλεγόταν από τον λαό με άμεση ψηφοφορία, για επταετή θητεία και χωρίς δυνατότητα επανεκλογής (αρ. 30).
Είχε την αρμοδιότητα να διορίζει και να παύει τους Υπουργούς και υφυπουργούς Εθνικής Άμυνας, Εξωτερικών και Δημόσιας Τάξης χωρίς την ανάμειξη του πρωθυπουργού και να ασκεί άμεσα την εκτελεστική εξουσία σε αυτούς τους τομείς (αρ. 49 παρ. 1). Επίσης, είχε την αρμοδιότητα έκδοσης διαταγμάτων και καθορισμού των κονδυλίων του προϋπολογισμού για αυτούς τους τομείς, προήδρευε στο υπουργικό συμβούλιο κατά τη συζήτηση σχετικών ζητημάτων (αρ. 87 παρ. 2), ο δε κανόνας της υπουργικής προσυπογραφής των πράξεών του κάμπτονταν σε μία σειρά περιπτώσεων (αρ. 40).
Ο Πρόεδρος της Δημοκρατίας αποκτούσε, επιπλέον, την αρμοδιότητα κήρυξης της χώρας σε κατάσταση πολιορκίας (αρ. 25) και διορισμού του αρχηγού των ενόπλων δυνάμεων (αρ. 49 παρ. 2). Ακόμα, Πρόεδρος και Αντιπρόεδρος ήταν καταρχήν ανεύθυνοι για πράξεις που τέλεσαν κατά την εκτέλεση των καθηκόντων τους, με την εξαίρεση των περιπτώσεων της εσχάτης προδοσίας και της εκ προθέσεως παραβίασης του Συντάγματος (αρ. 41)».
Αλλά η εξέγερση δεν επηρέασε μόνο το σύνταγμα της Χούντας, έδωσε στίγμα και για το πρώτο Σύνταγμα της Μεταπολίτευσης, το 1975. Και αυτό συνέβη υπό το φόβο μιας νέας εξέγερσης στην περίπτωση που οι ελευθερίες που δίνονταν στο λαό ήταν πετσοκομμένες.
Διαφωτιστικός ως προς αυτό είναι ο πολιτικός επιστήμονας Σεραφείμ Σεφεριάδης, ο οποίος στο άρθρο του, «Ο άδηλος ρόλος των συλλογικών δράσεων στην ελληνική καθεστωτική αλλαγή«, αναφέρεται στη διαμόρφωση του Συντάγματος του 1975 και στον Κωνσταντίνο Καραμανλής, λέγοντας πως «δεν θα συμπεριφερόταν με τον “προσεκτικό” τρόπο που συμπεριφέρθηκε αν δεν εκτιμούσε – υπό το φως του Πολυτεχνείου, αλλά και των προδικτατορικών μαχητικών συλλογικών δράσεων – ότι αυτές θα μπορούσαν κάλλιστα να επαναληφθούν».

--- Full Text ---
Οι φθινοπωρινές οικονομικές προβλέψεις της Ευρωπαϊκής Επιτροπής για το 2025 δείχνουν ότι η ανάπτυξη κατά τα τρία πρώτα τρίμηνα του 2025 υπερέβη τις προσδοκίες. Ενώ οι υψηλές επιδόσεις οφείλονταν αρχικά στην αύξηση των εξαγωγών εν αναμονή των αυξήσεων των δασμών, η οικονομία της ΕΕ συνέχισε να αναπτύσσεται το τρίτο τρίμηνο.
Όσον αφορά τις μελλοντικές εξελίξεις, η οικονομική δραστηριότητα αναμένεται να συνεχίσει να επεκτείνεται με μέτριο ρυθμό στη διάρκεια του χρονικού ορίζοντα των προβλέψεων, παρά το δύσκολο εξωτερικό περιβάλλον.
Οι φετινές φθινοπωρινές προβλέψεις προβλέπουν αύξηση του πραγματικού ΑΕΠ κατά 1,4 % στην ΕΕ το 2025 και το 2026, με αύξηση έως και 1,5 % το 2027. Η ζώνη του ευρώ αναμένεται να αντικατοπτρίζει αυτή την τάση, καθώς το πραγματικό ΑΕΠ προβλέπεται να αυξηθεί κατά 1,3 % το 2025, 1,2 % το 2026 και 1,4 % το 2027.
Ο πληθωρισμός στη ζώνη του ευρώ προβλέπεται να συνεχίσει να μειώνεται, φθάνοντας στο 2,1% το 2025, και να κυμανθεί γύρω στο 2% κατά τη διάρκεια του χρονικού ορίζοντα των προβλέψεων. Στην ΕΕ, ο πληθωρισμός αναμένεται να παραμείνει οριακά υψηλότερος και να μειωθεί στο 2,2 % το 2027.
Όπως αναφέρει η Κομισιόν, η οικονομία της Ελλάδας αναμένεται να συνεχίσει να αναπτύσσεται με ισχυρό ρυθμό, με προβλεπόμενη ανάπτυξη 2,1% το 2025 και 2,2% το 2026, υποστηριζόμενη από σταθερή κατανάλωση και επενδύσεις που υποστηρίζονται από κονδύλια της ΕΕ. Η αύξηση του ΑΕΠ προβλέπεται να μετριαστεί στο 1,7% το 2027, καθώς το RRF πλησιάζει στο τέλος του.
Ο πληθωρισμός αναμένεται να μειωθεί σταδιακά, στο 2,4% έως το 2027, καθώς η ισχυρή ζήτηση και η προβλεπόμενη αύξηση των τιμών της ενέργειας θα ασκήσουν ανοδική πίεση στις τιμές καταναλωτή. Η ανεργία μειώνεται σε επίπεδα που δεν έχουν παρατηρηθεί εδώ και περισσότερο από μια δεκαετία, αλλά εξακολουθούν να υπάρχουν διαρθρωτικές προκλήσεις.
Οι δημοσιονομικές προοπτικές της Ελλάδας παραμένουν ευνοϊκές για την περίοδο 2025-27, με γενικά σταθερά πρωτογενή πλεονάσματα, παρά τις φορολογικές περικοπές και τα κοινωνικά μέτρα. Η ισχυρή ονομαστική αύξηση του ΑΕΠ και τα πλεονάσματα του προϋπολογισμού αναμένεται να διατηρήσουν τον λόγο χρέους προς ΑΕΠ σε πτωτική τάση, κινούμενος κάτω από το 140% έως το 2027.
Δείκτες 2025, 2026, 2027
Το πρώτο εξάμηνο του 2025, η οικονομία της Ελλάδας αναπτύχθηκε κατά 2% σε ετήσια βάση, κυρίως λόγω της ιδιωτικής κατανάλωσης και του τουρισμού. Οι επενδύσεις αυξήθηκαν το δεύτερο τρίμηνο, ιδίως οι επενδύσεις σε κατασκευές και εξοπλισμό.
Συνολικά, η οικονομία αναμένεται να διατηρήσει την αναπτυξιακή της δυναμική κατά το δεύτερο εξάμηνο του 2025 και καθ’ όλη τη διάρκεια του 2026. Η επενδυτική δραστηριότητα αναμένεται να παραμείνει ισχυρή το 2025 και το 2026, υποστηριζόμενη από τη διψήφια αύξηση του εταιρικού δανεισμού και την εφαρμογή του RRP.
H ισχυρή ζήτηση και η ακόμη στενή αγορά εργασίας αναμένεται να διατηρήσουν ανοδικές πιέσεις στις τιμές καταναλωτή
Επιπλέον, ένα νέο πακέτο επεκτατικών δημοσιονομικών μέτρων αναμένεται να ενισχύσει την αύξηση των καθαρών μισθών και την ιδιωτική κατανάλωση. Η ζήτηση εισαγωγών αναμένεται να παραμείνει ισχυρή, δεδομένου του υψηλού εισαγωγικού περιεχομένου των επενδύσεων.
Αν και δεν αναμένεται απότομη ύφεση, η ανάπτυξη προβλέπεται να επιβραδυνθεί μετά το 2026, καθώς η εφαρμογή του RRP πλησιάζει στο τέλος της. Η αύξηση του ΑΕΠ προβλέπεται να είναι σχετικά σταθερή, με ρυθμούς 2,1% το 2025 και 2,2% το 2026, πριν μετριαστεί σε 1,7% το 2027. Ενώ η οικονομία έχει μέχρι στιγμής επιδείξει ανθεκτικότητα στις εξωτερικές προκλήσεις, μια παρατεταμένη αύξηση της γεωπολιτικής ή εμπορικής αβεβαιότητας και του κόστους χρηματοδότησης θα μπορούσε να επηρεάσει σημαντικά τις εξαγωγές, ιδίως στον τουριστικό τομέα, και την επενδυτική δραστηριότητα.
Το ποσοστό ανεργίας μειώθηκε στο 8,2% τον Οκτώβριο του 2025, το χαμηλότερο επίπεδό του από το 2009, αλλά παραμένει πάνω από τον μέσο όρο της ΕΕ. Μετά την κορύφωσή του το δεύτερο τρίμηνο του 2024, τα ποσοστά κενών θέσεων εργασίας έχουν μειωθεί ελαφρώς, αν και εξακολουθούν να υποδηλώνουν μια σχετικά περιορισμένη αγορά εργασίας, ιδίως στους τομείς του τουρισμού και των κατασκευών.
Η απασχόληση αναμένεται να συνεχίσει να αυξάνεται, αν και με βραδύτερο ρυθμό λόγω διαρθρωτικών ζητημάτων, όπως το χάσμα δεξιοτήτων και τα χαμηλά ποσοστά συμμετοχής, ιδίως μεταξύ των γυναικών. Οι μισθοί ανά εργαζόμενο αναμένεται να επιταχυνθούν, με μέσο ετήσιο ρυθμό ανάπτυξης 3,6% κατά την περίοδο πρόβλεψης, εν μέρει λόγω των προηγούμενων αυξήσεων των κατώτατων μισθών, της μείωσης των εισφορών κοινωνικής ασφάλισης και της πρόσφατα ανακοινωθείσας μεταρρύθμισης του φόρου εισοδήματος φυσικών προσώπων.
Αφού διαμορφώθηκε κατά μέσο όρο στο 3,1% το πρώτο εξάμηνο του 2025, ο γενικός πληθωρισμός μειώθηκε στο 1,7% μέχρι τον Οκτώβριο, λόγω της μείωσης του πληθωρισμού στην ενέργεια και τις υπηρεσίες.
Ωστόσο, η ισχυρή ζήτηση και η ακόμη στενή αγορά εργασίας αναμένεται να διατηρήσουν ανοδικές πιέσεις στις τιμές καταναλωτή. Ως αποτέλεσμα, ο πληθωρισμός προβλέπεται να μειωθεί με αργό ρυθμό, φτάνοντας το 2,8% το 2025 και το 2,3% το 2026. Ενώ ο γενικός πληθωρισμός εξαιρουμένης της ενέργειας και των τροφίμων αναμένεται να μειωθεί, η προβλεπόμενη αύξηση των τιμών της ενέργειας αναμένεται να διατηρήσει τον πληθωρισμό στο 2,4% το 2027.
Το ονομαστικό πλεόνασμα της γενικής κυβέρνησης αναμένεται να μειωθεί από 1,2% του ΑΕΠ το 2024 σε περίπου 1,1% το 2025. Αυτό αντανακλά τη μείωση του πρωτογενούς πλεονάσματος από 4,7% σε 4,3%, η οποία αντισταθμίζεται εν μέρει από τη μείωση των δαπανών για τόκους. Η μείωση αυτή προέρχεται κυρίως από επεκτατικά μέτρα (0,7% του ΑΕΠ), συμπεριλαμβανομένης της μείωσης των εισφορών κοινωνικής ασφάλισης κατά 1 ποσοστιαία μονάδα, των υψηλότερων μισθών στον δημόσιο τομέα, της επιστροφής ενοικίου βάσει εισοδηματικών κριτηρίων και ενός μόνιμου ετήσιου επιδόματος 250 ευρώ για τα ευάλωτα άτομα.
Πρόσθετες πιέσεις περιλαμβάνουν τις υψηλότερες δαπάνες για την υγειονομική περίθαλψη και την άμυνα, καθώς και μια δημοσιονομική διόρθωση που σχετίζεται με τις γεωργικές επιδοτήσεις της ΕΕ που ισοδυναμεί με 0,2% του ΑΕΠ. Αυτές οι επιπτώσεις αντισταθμίζονται εν μέρει από την αύξηση των εσόδων, η οποία υποστηρίζεται από τα τρέχοντα μέτρα φορολογικής συμμόρφωσης, την επέκταση της ψηφιακής κάρτας εργασίας σε νέους τομείς προκειμένου να μειωθεί η αδήλωτη εργασία, και τα υψηλότερα τέλη της τοπικής αυτοδιοίκησης.
Το 2026, το ισοζύγιο του προϋπολογισμού προβλέπεται να φτάσει το 0,3%, σημειώνοντας μείωση 0,8 ποσοστιαίων μονάδων σε σύγκριση με το 2025. Αυτό αντιστοιχεί σε πρωτογενές πλεόνασμα 3,4% του ΑΕΠ. Η μείωση αυτή αντανακλά κυρίως ένα πρόσφατα ανακοινωθέν επεκτατικό δημοσιονομικό πακέτο, το οποίο εκτιμάται ότι θα κοστίσει 0,6% του ΑΕΠ το 2026 και 0,8% του ΑΕΠ το 2027.
Το πακέτο συνδυάζει μειώσεις στον φόρο εισοδήματος φυσικών προσώπων, στον φόρο ακίνητης περιουσίας και στον ΦΠΑ, μαζί με στοχευμένες αυξήσεις στις συντάξεις και τους μισθούς του δημόσιου τομέα. Αυτά τα μέτρα έχουν σχεδιαστεί για να μετριάσουν τις πιέσεις του κόστους ζωής και να παράσχουν στήριξη σε νοικοκυριά χαμηλότερου και μεσαίου εισοδήματος, οικογένειες με παιδιά, συνταξιούχους και κατοίκους μικρών χωριών. Η πρόβλεψη περιλαμβάνει επίσης υψηλότερες αμυντικές δαπάνες, οι οποίες αναμένεται να αυξηθούν από 2,4% του ΑΕΠ το 2025 σε 2,6% το 2026.
Το 2027, το ονομαστικό ισοζύγιο προβλέπεται να μειωθεί στο 0,0% του ΑΕΠ, που αντιστοιχεί σε πρωτογενές πλεόνασμα 3,2%. Αυτή η επιδείνωση του ονομαστικού ισοζυγίου αντανακλά κυρίως τις υψηλότερες δαπάνες για τόκους και τον αντίκτυπο του νέου δημοσιονομικού πακέτου σε ολόκληρο το έτος.
Ο δείκτης δημόσιου χρέους προς ΑΕΠ διαμορφώθηκε στο 154,2% το 2024, 55 ποσοστιαίες μονάδες κάτω από το ανώτατο επίπεδό του το 2020. Αναμένεται να μειωθεί περαιτέρω, φτάνοντας στο 138% το 2027. Η μείωση αναμένεται να οφείλεται στην αύξηση του ονομαστικού ΑΕΠ, καθώς και στα πρωτογενή πλεονάσματα του προϋπολογισμού.

Το δικό της αφήγημα περί μίας επικείμενης σύγκρουσης στην Κυπριακή Δημοκρατία, που θα μπορούσε να εξελιχθεί ακόμα και σε πόλεμο με ηθικό αυτουργό το Ισραήλ προσπαθεί να οικοδομήσει η Μιλλιέτ , σε άρθρο του Οζάι Σεντίρ, διευθυντή της εφημερίδας.
Σύμφωνα με το άρθρο που η Μιλλιέτ τιτλφορεί «Πρός πόλεμο βαδίζει η Κύπρος» ο Σεντίρ υποστηρίζει ότι μεταξύ άλλων ότι «το Ισραήλ θέλει να ξεσπάσει σύγκρουση ή ακόμα και πόλεμος στην Κύπρο για τα δικά του συμφέροντα. Αν ξεσπάσει πόλεμος στην Κύπρο, θα προκληθεί μεγάλη κρίση στις σχέσεις ΕΕ-Τουρκίας, ΗΠΑ-Τουρκίας, η Ελλάδα θα κινητοποιήσει το ΝΑΤΟ και θα επιβληθούν οικονομικά και στρατιωτικά εμπάργκο στην Τουρκία. Έτσι, δεν θα υπάρχει κανένα εμπόδιο στο να διαμορφώσει το Ισραήλ τη Μέση Ανατολή όπως θέλει».
Ένα αφήγημα που έχει υποστηριχθεί εμμέσως και από την τουρκική διπλωματία.
Ολόκληρο το άρθρο του Οζάι Σεντίρ στη Μιλλιέτ:
«Στην Ευρώπη υπάρχουν γνωστές ιδιωτικές εταιρείες υπηρεσιών άμυνας.
Η ESA στην Πολωνία, η Alfa Metal στη Βουλγαρία, η Αντιτρομοκρατική Ακαδημία στην Τσεχία και η Hard Task Training…
Σε αυτές τις 4 εταιρείες που ανέφερα, πολλοί Ελληνοκύπριοι λαμβάνουν στρατιωτική εκπαίδευση τον τελευταίο καιρό.
Η επιφανειακή πλευρά του θέματος είναι ότι αυτή η στρατιωτική εκπαίδευση λαμβάνεται με σκοπό την εύρεση εργασίας ως φύλακας ασφαλείας (security) στην Κυπριακή Δημοκρατία (σς στη Νότια Κύπρο όπως αποκαλεί η Τουρκία την Κυπριακή Δημοκρατία).
Στον κόσμο δεν παρέχεται βαριά στρατιωτική εκπαίδευση για υπαλλήλους ασφαλείας σε εμπορικά κέντρα, νυχτερινά κέντρα ή τράπεζες, αλλά αυτό το ζήτημα μόλις αποκαλύφθηκε.
Η Κυπριακή Κυβέρνηση, υπό το πρόσχημα της συνεργασίας με τον ιδιωτικό τομέα, θα στείλει τους αποφοίτους αυτής της επιχειρησιακής εκπαίδευσης στο πεδίο μάχης μαζί με την Εθνική Φρουρά της Κύπρου.
Αυτό είναι το νέο σχέδιο όσων εκπαιδεύουν τους ιερείς στη χρήση όπλων.
Προς πόλεμο στην Κύπρο…
Έζησα πολλά χρόνια στη Βόρεια Κύπρο (σς στα κατεχόμενα), είδα πολλές εντάσεις, άκουσα πολλές φορές τη φράση «ο πόλεμος πλησιάζει».
Το 1989, ήμουν στο Aslanköy, όταν οι ελληνοκύπριες γυναίκες παραβίασαν τα σύνορα με το σύνθημα «Επιστρέφουμε στα σπίτια μας».
Έζησα τις προσπάθειες των Ρωμιών να αποκτήσουν S-300, την προσπάθεια των Ρωμιών φασιστών να κατεβάσουν την τουρκική σημαία από τον ιστό, την πλήρη συσκότιση που ίσχυε παλαιότερα μαζί με την απαγόρευση κυκλοφορίας, όταν ακόμη και τα παράθυρα των σπιτιών καλύπτονταν με κουβέρτες.
Από το 1974, για πρώτη φορά βλέπω τον κίνδυνο σύγκρουσης στην Κύπρο να αυξάνεται τόσο πολύ.
Αυτό που αυξάνει τόσο πολύ τον κίνδυνο σύγκρουσης δεν είναι τα όπλα που αγόρασαν οι Ελληνοκύπριοι από το Ισραήλ ούτε οι άνθρωποι που έλαβαν στρατιωτική εκπαίδευση.
Η στρατιωτική παρουσία των Τουρκικών Ενόπλων Δυνάμεων στο νησί ανανεώνεται συνεχώς, ώστε να εξουδετερώνει κάθε είδους απόπειρα.
Αυτό που αυξάνει τον κίνδυνο σύγκρουσης είναι η άνοδος της ακροδεξιάς, των παραστρατιωτικών ομάδων και η μεταβίβαση του ελέγχου από την Εκκλησία στο Ισραήλ στην ελληνοκυπριακή πλευρά από το 2010…
Στην Τουρκία, σχεδόν κανείς δεν γνωρίζει ότι το ακροδεξιά ΕΛΑΜ πραγματοποίησε πολλές επιθέσεις εναντίον των Τούρκοκυπρίων που πέρασαν στο Νότο πέρυσι.
Δεν υπάρχει μόνο το φασιστική ΕΛΑΜ, αλλά και η ακροδεξιά οργάνωση της νεολαίας του ΔΗΣΥ, οργανωμένες ομάδες που λειτουργούν υπό την ονομασία «Τέταρτη Αμερικανική Σημαία» και έχουν διαπράξει πολλά εγκλήματα.
Αυτές οι ομάδες είναι κυρίως εχθρικές προς τους Τούρκους, αλλά έχουν πραγματοποιήσει επιδρομές σε πολλά αραβικά καταστήματα στη Λεμεσό και την Πάφο.
Μοτοσυκλετιστές φορώντας μαύρες μάσκες και οδηγώντας με μοτοσικλέτες, λεηλάτησαν τα καταστήματα.
Στη Νότια Κύπρο (σσ όπως η Τουρκία αποκαλεί την κυβέρνηση της Κυπριακής Δημοκρατίας) υπάρχει αυτή τη στιγμή μια φασιστική κυβέρνηση.
Σκεφτείτε ότι στην επιδρομή που έκαναν 600 μοτοσικλετιστές μέρα μεσημέρι, μόνο 12 άτομα συνελήφθησαν.
Το χειρότερο από το ότι αυτή η κυβέρνηση είναι φασιστική είναι ότι δεν ελέγχεται πλέον από την Αθήνα, αλλά από το Τελ Αβίβ.
Το Ισραήλ, που χρηματοδότησε την δημιουργία ένοπλων ομάδων κατά της Χαμάς στη Γάζα και χρηματοδότησε την εξέγερση των Δρούζων στη Συρία, τώρα ρίχνει όλη του τη δύναμη στη Νότια Κύπρο.
Το Ισραήλ θέλει να ξεσπάσει σύγκρουση ή ακόμα και πόλεμος στην Κύπρο για τα δικά του συμφέροντα.
Αν ξεσπάσει πόλεμος στην Κύπρο, θα προκληθεί μεγάλη κρίση στις σχέσεις ΕΕ-Τουρκίας, ΗΠΑ-Τουρκίας, η Ελλάδα θα κινητοποιήσει το ΝΑΤΟ και θα επιβληθούν οικονομικά και στρατιωτικά εμπάργκο στην Τουρκία. Έτσι, δεν θα υπάρχει κανένα εμπόδιο στο να διαμορφώσει το Ισραήλ τη Μέση Ανατολή όπως θέλει.
Ο κίνδυνος είναι να οδηγήσει το Ισραήλ αυτούς τους φασίστες σε δολοφονίες ή σαμποτάζ στο Βορρά, να οργανώσει θανατηφόρες επιθέσεις εναντίον των Τούρκων που περνάνε στο Νότο…
Ξέρουν ότι όταν συμβεί κάτι τέτοιο, η Τουρκία θα ανταποδώσει με το ίδιο νόμισμα.
Το Ισραήλ δεν αρκέστηκε στο να θέσει υπό τον έλεγχό του τους Ρωμιούς φασίστες.
Εδώ και καιρό προσπαθεί να προκαλέσει αναταραχές στην Ανατολική Μεσόγειο και να αναγκάσει την Τουρκία να επέμβει. Το Ισραήλ και ο ελληνοκυρπιακός τομέας βρίσκουν χρηματοδότηση για τις ηλεκτρικές διασυνδέσεις της Ελλάδας, εξοπλίζουν την Ελλάδα και προσπαθούν να στήσουν κάθε είδους παιχνίδι.
Ο Χριστοδουλίδης, ο οποίος ηγείται του ελληνοκυπριακού τομέα (σς όπως η Τουρκία αποκαλεί την Κυπριακή Δημοκρατία), είναι ένας άνδρας χωρίς κόμμα και βάση, ο οποίος παραιτήθηκε από το Υπουργείο Εξωτερικών και εξελέγη.
Ίσως λόγω της έλλειψης βάσης, είναι ένας άνδρας που παίζει το παιχνίδι της Εκκλησίας και στηρίζεται στους φασίστες.
Φέτος δεν κουράστηκε να γιορτάσει τα 70 χρόνια της ΕΟΚΑ, που σκότωσε Τούρκους.
Οι Ελληνοκύπριοι είναι μάστορες στη διαστρέβλωση της ιστορίας. Στα σχολικά βιβλία γράφουν «το 1974 ήρθαν οι Τούρκοι και κατέλαβαν το νησί», αλλά δεν λένε στα παιδιά τους πώς σκότωσαν τους Τούρκους, πώς εφάρμοσαν το Σχέδιο Ακρίτας.
Ο ασταθής Ελληνοκύπριος ηγέτης (σς όπως αποκαλεί η Τουρκία τον Πρόεδρο της Κυπριακής Δημοκρατίας) παρουσιάζει την ΕΟΚΑ ως οργάνωση που αγωνίστηκε ενάντια στους Άγγλους, αλλά δεν μπορεί να μιλήσει για τους Τούρκους που σφαγιάστηκαν από την ΕΟΚΑ και για τους Ελληνοκύπριους που ήταν υπέρ της ειρήνης.
Θα το πω εγώ, η ΕΟΚΑ σκότωσε περισσότερους Τούρκους και ειρηνιστές Ελληνοκύπριους από ότι Άγγλους.
Πριν από τον ασταθή Ελληνοκύπριο Πρόεδρο, είχαν μετατρέψει το σπίτι του αιματοβαμμένου φασίστα ιδρυτή της ΕΟΚΑ, Γκρίβα, σε μουσείο και τώρα, ενώ προσπαθούσαν να κατεβάσουν την τουρκική σημαία, έστησαν το άγαλμα του Σολωμού Σολωμού.
Την Ελληνοκυπριακή Εκκλησία την άφησα για το τέλος.
Η Ελληνοκυπριακή Εκκλησία είναι μια εκκλησία που δεν ασχολείται με πνευματικά θέματα. Τους αρέσει να βγάζουν πολλά λεφτά, ονειρεύονται να ρίξουν τους Τούρκους στη θάλασσα…
Μέχρι το 1974, αυτοί ήταν το ανθρώπινο δυναμικό της ΕΟΚΑ, και σήμερα μιλάνε για να διώξουν όλους τους Τούρκους από το νησί.
Τους αρέσουν τα λεφτά, παλιά είχαν τράπεζες, τώρα φτιάχνουν ηλιακούς σταθμούς και πουλάνε ρεύμα στο κράτος τους.
Ο αρχιεπίσκοπός τους έγραψε συστατικές επιστολές για τους πιο εγκληματίες ανθρώπους, παίρνοντας εκατοντάδες χιλιάδες ευρώ για την πώληση χρυσών διαβατηρίων.
Σήμερα καταλαβαίνω καλύτερα γιατί οι Καθολικοί έκλεισαν την Ορθόδοξη Εκκλησία όταν πήραν τον έλεγχο της Κύπρου.
Θέλουν να σκοτώσουν τους Τούρκους, αλλά η Οθωμανική Αυτοκρατορία επέτρεψε την επαναλειτουργία αυτής της Εκκλησίας, εντάξει;
Η Εκκλησία, που δεν ασκεί πνευματικό έργο αλλά καταλαβαίνει καλά τα οικονομικά, δεν ξέρουμε ακόμα τι υπηρεσίες προσφέρει στο Ισραήλ έναντι αμοιβής.
Ξέρουμε ότι ο ασταθής Ελληνοκύπριος ηγέτης και η Ελληνορθόδοξη Εκκλησία μισούν σήμερα περισσότερο τον Πρόεδρο της ΤΔΒΚ (σς όπως η Τουρκία αποκαλεί τα κατεχόμενα) Ερχουρμάν.
Είχαν άλλα όνειρα.
Αν είχαν μελετήσει λίγο το μάθημα τους, θα γνώριζαν τις σφοδρές κριτικές που είχε ασκήσει ο Ερχουρμάν κατά τα φοιτητικά του χρόνια στην τότε διοίκηση του CTP, η οποία είχε τεταμένες σχέσεις με την Τουρκία, αλλά τέτοιου είδους αντανακλαστικά σε πραγματικά κράτη, όχι σε κράτη που έχουν καταληφθεί.
Το αποτέλεσμα; Δεν θα αποτελέσει έκπληξη το ενδεζόμενο το Ισραήλ να χρησιμοποιήσει την Κύπρο για να καθυστερήσει και να δυσκολέψει την Τουρκία, την οποία θεωρεί ως το μοναδικό εμπόδιο.
Αυτή η εκμετάλλευση μπορεί να μην περιοριστεί μόνο σε εντάσεις στην Ανατολική Μεσόγειο, αλλά μπορεί να οδηγήσει και σε προκλήσεις σύγκρουσης στην Κύπρο.
Ο Ελληνοκύπριος ηγέτης (σς όπως η Τουρκία αποκαλεί τον Πρόεδρο της Κυπριακής Δημοκρατίας), που καταφεύγει στους φασίστες επειδή δεν έχει βάση, όταν τελικά καταλάβει τι του επιφυλάσσει το μέλλον, μπορεί να είναι πολύ αργά για τον ίδιο»…

--- Full Text ---
Ενα περίεργο τροχαίο δυστύχημα στον Νέο Κόσμο ερευνούν οι αρχές.
Θύμα του τροχαίου ένας 58χρονος, το όχημα του οποίου εξετράπη της πορείας του και προσέκρουσε σε παρκαρισμένο όχημα στην οδό Σουλιέ 9, το απόγευμα της Δευτέρας.
Ο άνδρας τραυματίστηκε σοβαρά και μεταφέρθηκε σε κρίσιμη κατάσταση στον Ευαγγελισμό, όπου λίγο αργότερα κατέληξε.
Αστυνομικές πηγές ανέφεραν πως εξετάζεται το ενδεχόμενο ο οδηγός να έπαθε ανακοπή καρδιάς πριν ή μετά την πρόσκρουση.
Επίσης, όπως διαπιστώθηκε, ο 58χρονος έφερε χτυπήματα στο κεφάλι με τους αστυνομικούς να εξετάζουν το ενδεχόμενο να γρονθοκοπήθηκε από επιβάτες διερχόμενου δικύκλου που πιθανόν εμπλέκεται στο τροχαίο.
Οι επιβάτες της μηχανής αναζητούνται.
Ηδη αστυνομικοί της ΕΛ.ΑΣ λαμβάνουν καταθέσεις από τους γείτονες.
Φως στα αίτια του θανάτου του 58χρονου αναμένεται να ρίξει η ιατροδικαστική έκθεση.

Η ΕΚΤ εργάζεται συστηματικά προκειμένου να διασφαλίσει από τεχνικής πλευράς την έκδοση του ψηφιακού ευρώ διαβεβαίωσε σήμερα το μέλος του εκτελεστικού συμβουλίου της Ευρωπαϊκής Κεντρικής Τράπεζας , Piero Cipollone, μιλώντας στο Ευρωπαϊκό Κοινοβούλιο.
Όπως είπε, τελική απόφαση του διοικητικού συμβουλίου της ΕΚΤ σχετικά με την έκδοση ψηφιακού ευρώ θα ληφθεί μόνο μετά την έγκριση της νομοθεσίας. Υποθέτοντας ότι οι Ευρωπαίοι νομοθέτες θα εγκρίνουν τον κανονισμό για τη θέσπιση του ψηφιακού ευρώ κατά τη διάρκεια του επόμενου έτους, θα μπορούσε να πραγματοποιηθεί πιλοτική εφαρμογή και να διενεργηθούν οι πρώτες συναλλαγές από τα μέσα του 2027, ενώ το ψηφιακό ευρώ θα μπορούσε να είναι έτοιμο για πρώτη έκδοση το 2029.
Ο P. Cipollone δήλωσε ότι οι καταναλωτές, οι έμποροι και οι τράπεζες «θα επωφεληθούν όλοι», ενώ η μείωση της εξάρτησης από μη ευρωπαϊκούς παρόχους θα ενισχύσει επίσης την ανθεκτικότητα, την αυτονομία και την οικονομική ασφάλεια της ηπείρου, σύμφωνα με το ΑΠΕ – ΜΠΕ.
Ο ίδιος δεν συμμερίστηκε τις ανησυχίες που έχουν εκφραστεί από την πλευρά των τραπεζών για τη επαγόμενη αύξηση του κόστους συναλλαγών από την έλευση του ψηφιακού ευρώ, αναφέροντας ότι επί του παρόντος οι ευρωπαϊκές τράπεζες ήδη χάνουν προμήθειες από τα διεθνή συστήματα καρτών, και πληρωμών. Με το ψηφιακό ευρώ, όπως τόνισε, «το μοντέλο αποζημίωσης θα διασφαλίσει ότι οι τράπεζες θα επωφελούνται”.
«Το ψηφιακό ευρώ θα παρέχει μια ψηφιακή μορφή μετρητών που θα συμπληρώνει τα τραπεζογραμμάτια και τα κέρματα με τα οποία είμαστε εξοικειωμένοι, εξασφαλίζοντας έτσι ότι οι πληρωμές -τόσο οι φυσικές όσο και οι ψηφιακές- θα συνεχίσουν να λειτουργούν ανά πάσα στιγμή, χωρίς να εξαρτώνται από αποφάσεις που λαμβάνονται εκτός Ευρώπης.
Το ψηφιακό ευρώ θα είναι μια ευρωπαϊκή λύση ψηφιακών πληρωμών που θα βασίζεται σε ευρωπαϊκή υποδομή – όλοι οι πάροχοι που έχουμε επιλέξει είναι υπήκοοι της ΕΕ και ελέγχονται από υπηκόους της ΕΕ.
Παράλληλα θα προστατεύσει τη νομισματική μας κυριαρχία ακόμη και με την επέκταση των σταθερών νομισμάτων -τα οποία επί του παρόντος είναι κυρίως εκφρασμένα σε ξένα νομίσματα- και των κρυπτονομισμάτων χωρίς αντίκρισμα» ανέφερε o k. Cipollone.
«Οι λειτουργίες του ψηφιακού ευρώ online και offline θα αλληλοσυμπληρώνονται, συνδυάζοντας την ευκολία των ψηφιακών πληρωμών με την ανθεκτικότητα και την προσβασιμότητα των μετρητών, επιτρέποντας τη χρήση του ψηφιακού ευρώ σε οποιαδήποτε κατάσταση, από πλατφόρμες ηλεκτρονικού εμπορίου έως απομακρυσμένες περιοχές χωρίς κάλυψη δικτύου», πρόσθεσε.

Η Πέι Τσουνγκ, μια 34χρονη από το Μπρούκλιν, εξαπατούσε επί μακρόν επιχειρηματίες εστιατορίων στη Νέα Υόρκη . Έκανε καριέρα στα social media υποστηρίζοντας ότι είναι food influencer.
Ωστόσο, συνελήφθη έπειτα από καταγγελίες ότι έτρωγε σε ακριβά εστιατόρια και έφευγε χωρίς να πληρώνει.
Η Πέι Τσουνγκ, που έχει 13.000 ακολούθους και ζει σε πολυτελές συγκρότημα κατοικιών, έχει συλληφθεί πέντε φορές από τα τέλη Οκτωβρίου. Οι αρχές και οι ιδιοκτήτες εστιατορίων κάνουν λόγο για συστηματική απάτη. Εμφανιζόταν στα εστιατόρια με επαγγελματικό εξοπλισμό, φωτογράφιζε τα πιάτα κορυφαίων εστιατορίων και στη συνέχεια δημοσίευε στο Instagram ενθουσιώδεις κριτικές για το φαγητό. Ωστόσο, δεν είχε πληρώσει ποτέ τον λογαριασμό.
Στο εστιατόριο Francie, στις 22 Οκτωβρίου, φέρεται να παρήγγειλε ένα μενού τεσσάρων πιάτων, συνολικής αξίας 188 δολαρίων. Όταν της ζητήθηκε να πληρώσει, πρότεινε να «ανταλλάξει» το γεύμα με δημοσιεύσεις και φωτογραφίες. Όλες οι κάρτες της απορρίφθηκαν. Τότε υποστήριξε ότι περίμενε χρήματα από την οικογένειά της.
Σύμφωνα με τον ιδιοκτήτη του εστιατορίου, η influencer Πέι Τσούνγκ επέστρεψε αρκετές φορές -παρά το ανεξόφλητο χρέος. Ωστόσο, στις 7 Νοεμβρίου κατανάλωσε φαγητό αξίας 83 δολαρίων και συνελήφθη επί τόπου. Οι αστυνομικοί τη γνώριζαν ήδη από ανάλογα περιστατικά.
Σε άλλο εστιατόριο, φέρεται να άφησε απλήρωτο λογαριασμό 146 δολαρίων στις 27 Οκτωβρίου. Σύμφωνα με τη διεύθυνση του εστιατορίου βρέθηκε να κρύβεται στην τουαλέτα. Και εργαζόμενος στο εστιατόριο κατήγγειλε ότι η Πέι Τσουνγκ προσπάθησε να πληρώσει με «άλλο τρόπο».
Πρότεινε σε σερβιτόρο να εξοφλήσει εκείνος τον λογαριασμό και να τον αποζημιώσει αυτή αφήνοντας σεξουαλικό υπονοούμενο.
Η 34χρονη influencer μέσα σε δύο μήνες έχει συλληφθεί σε μια σειρά από εστιατόρια στη Νέα Υόρκη.
Οι μηνύσεις εις βάρος της έχουν πάρει τον δρόμο της δικαιοσύνης.

Σε ηλικία 91 ετών έφυγε από τη ζωή ο Ομότιμος Καθηγητής της Ιατρικής Σχολής του ΕΚΠΑ Στέφανος Ι. Χατζηγιάννης.
Τον εκλιπόντα, πρωτοπόρο της ηπατολογίας και διακεκριμένο δάσκαλο της Ιατρικής Αθηνών, αποχαιρέτισε με σεβασμό και ευγνωμοσύνη για το έργο του ως ιατρού, δασκάλου και ερευνητή, η Ελληνική Εταιρεία Μελέτης Ήπατος.
Η κηδεία του θα τελεστεί την Τετάρτη 19 Νοεμβρίου στις 11 το πρωί στο Κοιμητήριο Παπάγου.
Ως Διευθυντής της Β΄ Παθολογικής Κλινικής στο ΓΝΑ «Ιπποκράτειο» ο Στ. Χατζηγιάννης συνέβαλλε ώστε να καταστεί η Κλινική ένα διεθνώς αναγνωρισμένο κέντρο αναφοράς
O oμ. καθ. Παθολογίας Στέφανος Χατζηγιάννης
Ο Ομότιμος Καθηγητής της Ιατρικής Σχολής του ΕΚΠΑ Στέφανος Ι. Χατζηγιάννης, γεννήθηκε στην Μυτιλήνη και αποφοίτησε από την Ιατρική Σχολή του ΕΚΠΑ. Mετά την απόκτηση του τίτλου της ειδικότητας στην Εσωτερική Παθολογία στο Νοσοκομείο Ευαγγελισμός υπό την διεύθυνση του Καθηγητή και μετέπειτα Ακαδημαϊκού Γ. Μερίκα, μετεκπαιδεύτηκε για 2 έτη στο διασημότερο τότε Κέντρο Ηπατολογίας στον κόσμο (Royal Free Hospital, Λονδίνο, 1967-68) υπό την διεύθυνση της Dame Sheila Sherlock. Το 1970 εξελέγη Υφηγητής Παθολογίας της Ιατρικής Σχολής του ΕΚΠΑ και στην συνέχεια υπηρέτησε ως μέλος (1973-1985) και αργότερα ως Διευθυντής της Β΄ Πανεπιστημιακής Παθολογικής Κλινικής και του Ομώνυμου Εργαστηρίου στο Γ.Ν.Α. «Ιπποκράτειο» (1985-2001).
Πρωτοπόρος κλινικός και ερευνητής στον χώρο της Ηπατολογίας με περισσότερες από 300 διεθνείς δημοσιεύσεις (πάνω από 37.000 αναφορές και h-index: 83), ο Καθηγητής Στέφανος Χατζηγιάννης εισήγε και καθιέρωσε την Ηπατολογία στη χώρα μας, ενώ υπήρξε δάσκαλος των περισσοτέρων Ελλήνων Ηπατολόγων.
Όπως τονίσθηκε από το ΕΚΠΑ, η συμβολή της βασικής και κλινικής του έρευνας από τις αρχές της δεκαετίας του 1970, έτυχε ευρείας διεθνούς αναγνωρίσεως και άσκησε μείζονα επίδραση στην ανάπτυξη διαγνωστικών, προληπτικών, θεραπευτικών στρατηγικών και Πολιτικών Δημόσιας Υγείας, κυρίως για τις ιογενείς ηπατοπάθειες, τόσο στην Ελλάδα όσο και διεθνώς.
Ως Διευθυντής της Β΄ Παθολογικής Κλινικής στο ΓΝΑ «Ιπποκράτειο» συνέβαλλε ώστε να καταστεί η Κλινική ένα διεθνώς αναγνωρισμένο κέντρο αναφοράς, όχι μόνο στα νοσήματα του Ήπατος, αλλά και στα Γαστρεντερολογικά, Μεταβολικά, Αιματολογικά, Ογκολογικά, Ρευματολογικά και άλλα νοσήματα της Παθολογίας. Η Β΄ Παθολογική Κλινική με το Ομώνυμο Εργαστήριο της υπό την εμπνευσμένη διεύθυνση του, εκπαίδευσε γενιές φοιτητών Ιατρικής του ΕΚΠΑ, ειδικευομένων και ειδικευμένων ιατρών στην Παθολογία προσφέροντας τους ταυτόχρονα την δυνατότητα για κλινική και βασική έρευνα. Ένας μεγάλος αριθμός αυτών των ιατρών κατέχει πλέον διακεκριμένες θέσεις σε Ακαδημαϊκά Κέντρα ή εργάζονται στο δημόσιο ή ιδιωτικό σύστημα υγείας στην Ελλάδα και στο εξωτερικό.
Ο Καθ. Στέφανος Ι. Χατζηγιάννης είχε διατελέσει Διευθυντής του Τομέα Παθολογίας και Αντιπρόεδρος της Ιατρικής Σχολής του ΕΚΠΑ (1991-1993) καθώς και Πρόεδρος του Εθνικού Κέντρου Αναφοράς Μεταδοτικών Νόσων του Ήπατος, του Ελληνικού Ινστιτούτου Παστέρ, της Εθνικής Επιτροπής Ιογενούς Ηπατίτιδας του Υπουργείου Υγείας και της Επιτροπής Ιογενούς Ηπατίτιδας του ΚΕΕΛΠΝΟ. Επιπλέον, είχε διατελέσει Πρόεδρος της Ευρωπαϊκής Εταιρείας για την Μελέτη του ‘Ηπατος (EASL) και το 2007 στη Γενική Συνέλευση της αναδείχθηκε Επίτιμος Πρόεδρος του Διεθνούς Συνεδρίου Ηπατολογίας. Για το επιστημονικό και ερευνητικό του έργο έχει τιμηθεί με πολλά Ελληνικά και Διεθνή βραβεία, ενώ το 2015 έλαβε το Αργυρό Μετάλλιο στην Τάξη των Θετικών Επιστημών από την Ακαδημία Αθηνών.
Στις 3 Απριλίου του 2025, η Ιατρική Σχολή του ΕΚΠΑ τον τίμησε με την έκδοση Τιμητικού Τόμου προς αναγνώριση του έργου του.

--- Full Text ---
Στο Κυπριακό, αναφέρθηκε ο πρόεδρος της Τουρκίας, Ρετζέπ Ταγίπ Ερντογάν, επιμένοντας στη «λύση των δύο κράτων». Σε δηλώσεις του μετά τη συνεδρίαση του υπουργικού συμβουλίου της Δευτέρας, ο Τούρκος πρόεδρος δήλωσε ότι η λύση του Κυπριακού περνά μέσα από τη συνύπαρξη δύο κρατών.
Ζήτησε δε από την ελληνοκυπριακή πλευρά να επιδείξει την «εποικοδομητική διάθεση» της τουρκοκυπριακής πλευρά. «Αν και η ελληνοκυπριακή πλευρά δείξει την εποικοδομητική διάθεση που δείχνουν οι Τουρκοκύπριοι, τότε στο νησί μπορεί να βρεθεί μια δίκαιη και ρεαλιστική λύση που θα βασίζεται στην ισότητα μέσα από την κυριαρχία και σε ισότιμο διεθνές καθεστώς», ανέφερε σχετικά.
Μετά από συνάντηση με τον ηγέτη του ψευδοκράτους – Τουφάν Ερχιούρμαν – την Πέμπτη 13 Νοεμβρίου, ο Ερντογάν κατηγόρησε πάλι την ελληνοκυπριακή πλευρά για το συνεχιζόμενο αδιέξοδο, «ισχυριζόμενος ότι απορρίπτει την κυριαρχική ισότητα και το ίσο διεθνές καθεστώς των Τουρκοκυπρίων, αρνούμενη να μοιραστεί την πολιτική εξουσία ή την οικονομική ευημερία».
Περιέγραψε το όραμα της ελληνοκυπριακής πλευράς για την Κύπρο ως «υποβάθμιση των Τουρκοκυπρίων σε μειονότητα εντός ενός δυσλειτουργικού κράτους που ιδρύθηκε το 1963» και άσκησε κριτική στην ΕΕ για την «αναγνώριση της νομιμότητας αυτής της διοίκησης». Ο Ερντογάν κατέληξε και τότε στο συμπέρασμα ότι η «πιο ρεαλιστική λύση» είναι η συνύπαρξη δύο κρατών στο νησί, με διατήρηση της ειρήνης, της ευημερίας και της ασφάλειας.
Είναι σαφές πως την τελευταία εβδομάδα, το Κυπριακό μπαίνει σε μια φάση συνομιλιών καθώς οι Τούφαν Ερχούρμαν και Νίκος Χριστοδουλίδης θα συναντηθούν στις 20 Νοεμβρίου, στην πρώτη τους συνάντηση από την ανάληψη των καθηκόντων του Ερχιούρμαν τον περασμένο μήνα. Ταυτόχρονα δεν λείπουν και οι εντάσεις.
Σύμφωνα με τις επίσημες δηλώσεις που εξέδωσαν ταυτόχρονα η τουρκική και η ελληνοκυπριακή πλευρά τη Δευτέρα, οι ηγέτες έχουν προγραμματίσει να συναντηθούν στην ουδέτερη ζώνη που ελέγχεται από τον ΟΗΕ, στην κατοικία του ειδικού εκπροσώπου του Γενικού Γραμματέα του ΟΗΕ.
Ο Τουφάν Ερχιούρμαν έκανε μια δήλωση στον λογαριασμό του στα μέσα κοινωνικής δικτύωσης σχετικά με τη συνάντηση που θα πραγματοποιήσει για πρώτη φορά με τον ηγέτη της ελληνοκυπριακής πλευράς. Σημειώνοντας ότι η βούληση για λύση, η ειλικρίνεια και η αμοιβαία εμπιστοσύνη θα εξασφαλίσουν αισιοδοξία, υπογράμμισε ότι «είναι καθήκον των ηγετών να δημιουργήσουν ένα κλίμα για λύση».
Ο Ερχιούρμαν σημείωσε επίσης ότι οι δηλώσεις σχετικά με τη διαδικασία πρέπει να γίνονται με προσοχή, λέγοντας: «Η άσκηση της μέγιστης προσοχής στις δηλώσεις σχετικά με τη διαδικασία είναι απαραίτητη για την πρόοδο και θα ενεργήσω με αυτή την ευθύνη».
Σχολιάζοντας το πεδίο εφαρμογής της πρώτης συνάντησης της Πέμπτης, ο Ερχιούρμαν είπε: «Δεν θα ήταν σωστό να αναμένουμε ότι θα καταλήξουμε σε σαφήνεια σχετικά με τα θέματα που έχουμε μπροστά μας μέσα σε μία ώρα και, το πιο σημαντικό, να δημιουργήσουμε μια τέτοια προσδοκία».
Συμπλήρωσε ότι «Ελπίζω ότι αυτή η πρώτη συνάντηση θα πραγματοποιηθεί σε μια ειλικρινή ατμόσφαιρα που θα δημιουργήσει αμοιβαία εμπιστοσύνη και θα ξεκινήσει μια διαδικασία συναντήσεων που θα συνεχίζονται σε σύντομα αλλά τακτά χρονικά διαστήματα».
Η συνάντηση Χριστοδουλίδη-Ερχiούρμαν θα πραγματοποιηθεί την Πέμπτη, 20 Νοεμβρίου, στις 9:30 π.μ., σύμφωνα με γραπτή δήλωση του κυβερνητικού εκπροσώπου Κωνσταντίνου Λετυμπιώτη. Η συνάντηση θα πραγματοποιηθεί στην κατοικία του Ειδικού Εκπροσώπου του Γενικού Γραμματέα του ΟΗΕ, στην περιοχή του παλαιού αεροδρομίου της Λευκωσίας, στο πλαίσιο των προσπαθειών του οργανισμού για την επανέναρξη των συνομιλιών για την Κύπρο.
Στη δήλωσή του, ο Λετυμπιώτης ανέφερε ότι ο πρόεδρος Νίκος Χριστοδουλίδης «προσέρχεται στη συνάντηση με την ίδια εποικοδομητική διάθεση και ειλικρινή πολιτική βούληση, στο πλαίσιο της προσπάθειας μας για την επανέναρξη ουσιαστικών διαπραγματεύσεων από το σημείο που έχουν διακοπεί στο Κραν Μοντανά, για την επίτευξη λύσης του Κυπριακού».
Στο τέλος της ανακοίνωσης υπογράμμισε ότι οποιαδήποτε λύση πρέπει να βασίζεται στις αποφάσεις του Συμβουλίου Ασφαλείας του ΟΗΕ, καθώς και στις αρχές και τις αξίες της Ευρωπαϊκής Ένωσης.

Σε πλήρη αναμόρφωση του προγράμματος Golden Visa προχωρά η κυβέρνηση με στόχο την απλοποίηση των διαδικασιών, την ενοποίηση των απαιτούμενων δικαιολογητικών και κυρίως την κατεύθυνση των ξένων επενδύσεων σε τομείς που εξυπηρετούν ευρύτερες κοινωνικές και στεγαστικές ανάγκες.
H Κοινή Υπουργική Απόφαση (ΚΥΑ) που δημοσιεύτηκε στην Εφημερίδα της Κυβέρνησης τις προηγούμενες ημέρες εξειδικεύει τις διαδικασίες και τα δικαιολογητικά που απαιτούνται για πολίτες τρίτων χωρών που πραγματοποιούν επενδύσεις σε real estate.
«Το Υπουργείο Μετανάστευσης και Ασύλου, ενισχύοντας την εθνική πολιτική για τις επενδύσεις και αναδιαμορφώνοντας το πλαίσιο των θεωρήσεων επενδυτή προς όφελος της κοινωνίας και της οικονομίας, προχωρά σε στοχευμένες παρεμβάσεις», τονίζει στο ΑΠΕ-ΜΠΕ ο υπουργός Μετανάστευσης και Ασύλου, Θάνος Πλεύρης, που υπογράφει την ΚΥΑ μαζί με τον υπουργό Εθνικής Οικονομίας, Κυριάκο Πιερρακάκη, τον υπουργό Ανάπτυξης, Τάκη Θεοδωρικάκο και τον υφυπουργό Περιβάλλοντος και Ενέργειας, Νικόλαο Ταγάρα.
Προκειμένου να μειωθεί η γραφειοκρατία και να γίνει το πλαίσιο «πιο διαφανές, ενιαίο και λειτουργικό για επενδυτές, αλλά ταυτόχρονα ελεγχόμενο», ενοποιούνται και απλοποιούνται οι διαδικασίες.
Όπως αναφέρεται στη σχετική ΚΥΑ, όλοι οι τύποι επένδυσης (αγορά ακινήτου, χρονομεριστική μίσθωση, διατηρητέα, αλλαγή χρήσης, οικόπεδα κ.λπ.) αποκτούν κοινό πλαίσιο δικαιολογητικών και επίσης δίνεται η δυνατότητα ηλεκτρονικής υποβολής αίτησης χωρίς φυσική παρουσία. Στην περίπτωση αυτή, ο επενδυτής μετά την υποβολή του αιτήματος, θα εισέρχεται στη χώρα για την υποβολή των απαιτούμενων βιομετρικών δεδομένων.
Παράλληλα, απαιτείται ασφαλιστήριο συμβόλαιο ιδιωτικού φορέα ασφάλισης και ηλεκτρονικό παράβολο ύψους δύο χιλιάδων ευρώ για κάθε αίτηση, καθώς και προξενικό τέλος 180 ευρώ για τη θεώρηση εισόδου.
Επίσης, είναι απαραίτηση η βεβαίωση του συμβολαιογράφου που συνέταξε τις συμβολαιογραφικές πράξεις μεταβίβασης, με την οποία βεβαιώνονται τα στοιχεία των συμβαλλομένων μερών, τα στοιχεία του ακινήτου, το συμφωνηθέν τίμημα, ο τρόπος καταβολής του και όλα τα ειδικότερα στοιχεία διενέργειας της πληρωμής.
Στα στοιχεία του ακινήτου, συμπεριλαμβάνεται ρητή αναφορά στα τετραγωνικά μέτρα των κύριων χώρων του ακινήτου, εφόσον πρόκειται για δομημένη ακίνητη περιουσία ή ακίνητο για το οποίο έχει εκδοθεί οικοδομική άδεια, τα οποία θα πρέπει να έχουν ελάχιστη επιφάνεια κύριων χώρων τα εκατόν είκοσι τετραγωνικά μέτρα, όπου αυτή απαιτείται. Αντίστοιχα, είναι απαραίτητες οι βεβαιώσεις δικηγόρων και μηχανικών για την επένδυση.
«Κόφτης» στις βραχυχρόνιες μισθώσεις
Η κυβέρνηση επιδιώκει να σταματήσει τη χρήση της Golden Visa ως εργαλείο για μαζικές αγορές διαμερισμάτων που βγαίνουν άμεσα σε βραχυχρόνια μίσθωση, πρακτική που θεωρείται ότι αφαιρούσε κατοικίες από την αγορά και αύξανε τις τιμές των ενοικίων, επιδεινώνοντας με τον τρόπο αυτό το στεγαστικό πρόβλημα.
Με τον «κόφτη» που μπαίνει, επιδιώκεται η επιστροφή περισσότερων ακινήτων στη μακροχρόνια μίσθωση, η ενίσχυση της διαθεσιμότητας κατοικίας στους πολίτες και η στροφή των επενδυτών σε άλλα είδη ακινήτων (παλαιά, βιομηχανικά, διατηρητέα).
Για τον λόγο αυτό, απαγορεύεται η βραχυχρόνια μίσθωση για νέες επενδύσεις από το 2024 και μετά και επιτρέπονται μόνο οι χρονομεριστικές μισθώσεις (για συγκεκριμένο διάστημα κάθε χρόνο) και οι μακροχρόνιες συμβάσεις τουλάχιστον πέντε ετών σε σύνθετα τουριστικά καταλύματα.
Επενδύσεις σε παλιά εργοστάσια και βιομηχανικά κτίρια – νέοι όροι για αλλαγή χρήσης
Προβλέπονται επίσης αλλαγές, προκειμένου να δοθεί ώθηση σε αναπλάσεις εγκαταλελειμμένων βιομηχανικών κτιρίων που μπορούν να μετατραπούν σε κατοικίες ή σύγχρονα συγκροτήματα, αντί για περαιτέρω πίεση στο στεγαστικό από την αγορά κατοικιών αποκλειστικά για επενδυτικούς σκοπούς.
Ειδικότερα, για να μετατραπεί βιομηχανικό κτίριο σε κατοικία, απαιτείται τεχνική έκθεση μηχανικού που να πιστοποιεί ότι το κτίριο δεν λειτουργούσε ως βιομηχανία τα τελευταία 5 χρόνια κάτι που αποδεικνύεται μέσω βεβαίωσης διακοπής ηλεκτροδότησης (ΔΕΔΔΗΕ/Δήμος), εντύπων Ε2 των τελευταίων 5 ετών ή άλλων δημόσιων εγγράφων.
Επενδύσεις σε οικόπεδα ή αγροτεμάχια – ευελιξία στους υπολογισμούς
Με στόχο να ενθαρρυνθεί η πραγματική ανάπτυξη νέων κατοικιών και όχι απλή αγορά έτοιμων διαμερισμάτων που αφαιρούνται από το οικιστικό απόθεμα για την απόκτηση Golden Visa μπορεί να υπολογίζεται είτε η αξία αγοράς του οικοπέδου/αγροτεμαχίου και το κόστος ανέγερσης είτε μόνο το κόστος ανέγερσης.
Διευκόλυνση επενδύσεων σε διατηρητέα κτίρια
Για να ενισχυθεί η αναβίωση του ιστορικού κτιριακού αποθέματος της χώρας, μέσω κινήτρων που στρέφουν τους επενδυτές σε ακίνητα υψηλής πολιτιστικής αξίας για διατηρητέα ακίνητα απαιτείται τεχνική έκθεση που να επιβεβαιώνει την ολοκλήρωση εργασιών αποκατάστασης ή ανακατασκευής.
Η κυβέρνηση υποστηρίζει ότι συνολικά η νέα Κοινή Υπουργική Απόφαση επιδιώκει να περιορίσει φαινόμενα κερδοσκοπίας γύρω από την αγορά κατοικίας, να αυξήσει την προσφορά ακινήτων για μακροχρόνια μίσθωση για τους πολίτες, να απλοποιήσει τις διαδικασίες για σοβαρούς επενδυτές και να κατευθύνει την επενδυτική δραστηριότητα προς παλαιά/κλειστά/βιομηχανικά κτίρια, διατηρητέα ακίνητα και νέες επενδύσεις.
Με λίγα λόγια, επιχειρείται η Golden Visa να πάψει να λειτουργεί ως μηχανισμός αγοράς διαμερισμάτων για βραχυχρόνια μίσθωση και να γίνει εργαλείο αναβάθμισης του κτιριακού αποθέματος και στήριξης των στεγαστικών αναγκών.
«Με τη νέα Κοινή Υπουργική Απόφαση για την Golden Visa, διασφαλίζουμε την παρουσία περισσότερων ακινήτων στην αγορά, καθώς δίνουμε κίνητρα μετατροπής βιομηχανικών και εμπορικών κτιρίων σε κατοικίες, καταργούμε τη δυνατότητα βραχυχρόνιας μίσθωσης και παράλληλα αυξάνουμε το όριο των επενδύσεων», τονίζει ο υπουργός Μετανάστευσης και Ασύλου στο ΑΠΕ-ΜΠΕ, σημειώνοντας ότι «με αυτόν τον τρόπο, διασφαλίζουμε περισσότερες επενδύσεις στη χώρα και παράλληλα αυξάνουμε τα διαθέσιμα ακίνητα, συμβάλλοντας σε μια πιο ισορροπημένη και λειτουργική αγορά ακινήτων».

Την ώρα που η Επιτροπή Ανταγωνισμού αναζητά προσωπικό για να στελεχώσει τις υπηρεσίες της, χάνει και αυτούς που έχει.
Εκτός της Επιτροπής Ανταγωνισμού είναι, σύμφωνα με πληροφορίες, και ο προϊστάμενος του τμήματος ψηφιακής αναζήτησης πειστηρίων ο οποίος παραιτήθηκε.
Η διαπιστωτική πράξη, που υπογράφει η πρόεδρος της Αρχής, σηματοδοτεί την αποχώρηση ενός στελέχους που είχε προέλθει από τον ιδιωτικό τομέα, με θητεία η οποία δεν ολοκληρώθηκε.

Απέφυγε να σχολιάσει ο επίτροπος τυχόν διορθωτικές κινήσεις στον προϋπολογισμό λόγω ΟΠΕΚΕΠΕ.

--- Full Text ---
Παρά τις τρέχουσες γεωπολιτικές και γεωοικονομικές αντιξοότητες, η ανάπτυξη στην Ευρωπαϊκή Ενωση δείχνει να ξεπερνά τις προσδοκίες βάσει των φθινοπωρινών οικονομικών προβλέψεων της Κομισιόν για το 2025. Ενώ οι ισχυρές επιδόσεις οδηγήθηκαν αρχικά από την αύξηση των εξαγωγών εν αναμονή των αυξήσεων των δασμών, η οικονομία της Ε.Ε. συνέχισε να αναπτύσσεται το τρίτο τρίμηνο αναφέρει η σχετική έκθεση.
Για την Ελλάδα, η οικονομία θα εξακολουθήσει να αναπτύσσεται με ταχείς ρυθμούς φθάνοντας 2,1% το 2025 και 2,2% το 2026, που εξηγείται από τη σταθερή κατανάλωση και τις επενδύσεις, που υποστηρίζονται από τα ευρωπαϊκά κονδύλια. Ωστόσο, η αύξηση του ΑΕΠ αναμένεται να μετριαστεί στο 1,7% το 2027, όταν θα λήξει η λειτουργία του Ταμείου Ανάκαμψης (RRF).
«Συνολικά, η Ελλάδα διατηρεί ισχυρή δυναμική ως προς την ανάπτυξη, καθώς αναμένουμε να φτάσει 2,1% φέτος και 2,2% το επόμενο έτος», σχολίασε σχετικά ο αρμόδιος επίτροπος Βάλντις Ντομπρόβσκις, τονίζοντας παράλληλα ότι πρόκειται για «πολύ πάνω από τους μέσους όρους της Ευρωζώνης». Για τη χώρα μας, εξάλλου, ανέφερε ότι ο προϋπολογισμός σημειώνει πλεόνασμα, ενώ ο λόγος χρέους προς ΑΕΠ μειώνεται.
«Συνολικά, λοιπόν, βλέπουμε αρκετά ισχυρές επιδόσεις της ελληνικής οικονομίας», σημείωσε ο Ντομπρόβσκις, όμως, ερωτηθείς σχετικά για τυχόν ανησυχίες της Κομισιόν για πιθανές «διορθωτικές» κινήσεις στον εθνικό προϋπολογισμό λόγω της τρέχουσας υπόθεσης του ΟΠΕΚΕΠΕ απέφυγε να σχολιάσει, αρκούμενος να υπογραμμίσει ότι «αυτή τη στιγμή διεξάγονται έλεγχοι. Δεν μπορώ να προδικάσω το αποτέλεσμα. Επίσης, οι έλεγχοι και οι αρμόδιες υπηρεσίες της Επιτροπής βρίσκονται σε επαφή με τις ελληνικές αρχές».
Σε ό,τι αφορά τον πληθωρισμό, αναμένεται να μειωθεί στην Ελλάδα σταδιακά στο 2,4% το 2027 λόγω της σταθερής ζήτησης και της προβλεπόμενης αύξησης στις τιμές της ενέργειας, που θα ασκήσουν ανοδικές πιέσεις στις τιμές των καταναλωτικών αγαθών.
Για την ανεργία, η Κομισιόν αναφέρει ότι μειώνεται σε επίπεδα άνευ προηγουμένου για περισσότερο από μια δεκαετία, αλλά προειδοποιεί πως «εξακολουθούν να υπάρχουν διαρθρωτικές προκλήσεις».
Το ποσοστό ανεργίας μειώθηκε στο 8,2% τον Οκτώβριο του 2025, το χαμηλότερο επίπεδο από το 2009, αλλά παραμένει πάνω από τον μέσο όρο της Ε.Ε. Μετά την κορύφωσή τους το δεύτερο τρίμηνο του 2024, τα ποσοστά κενών θέσεων μειώθηκαν ελαφρώς, αν και εξακολουθούν να υποδηλώνουν μια σχετικά περιορισμένη αγορά εργασίας, ιδίως στους τομείς του τουρισμού και των κατασκευών.
Τα υψηλότερα ποσοστά ανεργίας παρατηρούνται στην Ισπανία, όπου φτάνουν το 10,4% το 2025, ποσοστό που θα πέσει κάτω από το 10% το 2026 και το 2027. Εντυπωσιακή αύξηση των ποσοστών ανεργίας σημειώνει, πάντως, η Φινλανδία, όπου θα φτάσει το 9,5% φέτος. Ο μέσος όρος της Ευρωζώνης θα είναι 6,3%, και ο μέσος όρος της Ε.Ε. 5,9%.
Σε ό,τι αφορά τις δημοσιονομικές προοπτικές της Ελλάδας, παραμένουν ευνοϊκές για την περίοδο 2025-2027, με γενικά σταθερά πρωτογενή πλεονάσματα, παρά τις φορολογικές περικοπές και τα κοινωνικά μέτρα. Η ισχυρή αύξηση του ονομαστικού ΑΕΠ και τα πλεονάσματα του προϋπολογισμού αναμένεται να διατηρήσουν τον δείκτη χρέους προς ΑΕΠ σε πτωτική τάση, κινούμενου κάτω από το 140% έως το 2027.
Στην Ευρώπη, το δημόσιο χρέος σε σχέση με το ΑΕΠ θα πέσει κάτω από το 100% το 2026: το επόμενο έτος, το ποσοστό θα είναι 98,2%. Και το 2027, το ποσοστό θα μειωθεί στο 97,1%. Πιο ανησυχητική είναι η κατάσταση στη Γαλλία και την Ιταλία, όπου η τάση είναι ανοδική. Η ιταλική οικονομία θα συσσωρεύσει δημόσιο χρέος 137% έως το 2027, πολύ κοντά σε αυτό της Ελλάδας, ενώ στη Γαλλία θα αυξηθεί από 116% το 2025 σε 120%. Πέμπτη κατά σειρά θα είναι η Ισπανία.
«Ακόμη και σε ένα δυσμενές περιβάλλον, η οικονομία της Ε.Ε. συνέχισε να αναπτύσσεται. Τώρα, δεδομένου του εξωτερικού πλαισίου, που ενέχει προκλήσεις η Ε.Ε. πρέπει να αναλάβει αποφασιστική δράση για να ξεκλειδώσει την εγχώρια ανάπτυξη», τόνισε ο Ντομπρόβσκις και σημείωσε ότι «αυτό σημαίνει επιτάχυνση των εργασιών μας σχετικά με το θεματολόγιο για την ανταγωνιστικότητα – μεταξύ άλλων με την απλούστευση της ρύθμισης, την ολοκλήρωση της Ενιαίας Αγοράς και την ενίσχυση της καινοτομίας».

Υποστήριξε ότι οι Τουρκοκύπριοι έχουν ήδη επιδείξει «θάρρος και βούληση» για μια νέα συμφωνία και κάλεσε την ελληνοκυπριακή πλευρά να ακολουθήσει τον ίδιο δρόμο.

--- Full Text ---
Νέο μήνυμα για το Κυπριακό απέστειλε ο Ρετζέπ Ταγίπ Ερντογάν μετά τη συνεδρίαση του υπουργικού συμβουλίου. Ο Τούρκος πρόεδρος επανέλαβε ότι, κατά την Αγκυρα, η επίλυση του Κυπριακού μπορεί να προκύψει μόνο μέσα από τη «συνύπαρξη δύο κρατών» στο νησί.
Υποστήριξε ότι οι Τουρκοκύπριοι έχουν ήδη επιδείξει «θάρρος και βούληση» για μια νέα συμφωνία, καλώντας την ελληνοκυπριακή πλευρά να ακολουθήσει τον ίδιο δρόμο. Μόνο τότε, όπως είπε, μπορεί να διαμορφωθεί μια «δίκαιη, ρεαλιστική και μόνιμη λύση» που θα στηρίζεται στην «κυριαρχική ισότητα» και στο «ισότιμο διεθνές καθεστώς» των δύο πλευρών.
Παράλληλα, προειδοποίησε ότι, εάν δεν υπάρξει ανταπόκριση, «δεν μπορεί να χτιστεί τίποτα πάνω στην αδικία», αφήνοντας να εννοηθεί πως η Τουρκία θα συνεχίσει να στηρίζει αταλάντευτα το μοντέλο των δύο κρατών στην Κύπρο.
Ολόκληρη η δήλωση Ερντογάν
«Στις 13 Νοεμβρίου, μετά την εκλογή του στην Προεδρία της Τουρκικής Δημοκρατίας της Βόρειας Κύπρου, υποδεχθήκαμε τον κ. Τουφάν Ερχουρμάν και τη σύζυγό του στην Αγκυρα, στο πλαίσιο της πρώτης επίσημης επίσκεψής του στο εξωτερικό.
Μαζί με τον κ. πρόεδρο, αξιολογήσαμε τα κοινά βήματα που μπορούν να γίνουν προς μια δίκαιη και μόνιμη λύση στο εθνικό μας ζήτημα της Κύπρου, η οποία θα ανταποκρίνεται στις πραγματικότητες του νησιού.
Είναι σημαντικό ότι ο κ. Ερχουρμάν έχει τονίσει πρόσφατα, στα μηνύματά του προς την ελληνοκυπριακή πλευρά, πως δεν πρόκειται να υπάρξει καμία υποχώρηση από την κυριαρχική ισότητα των Τουρκοκυπρίων.
Η “αναθέρμανση” προτάσεων που έχουν δοκιμαστεί επανειλημμένα στο παρελθόν χωρίς να αποδώσουν το θεωρούμε χάσιμο χρόνου.
Η λύση του Κυπριακού, όπως έχουμε τονίσει πολλές φορές, περνά μέσα από τη συνύπαρξη δύο κρατών.
Αν η ελληνοκυπριακή πλευρά επιδείξει το ίδιο θάρρος, τη βούληση και τη δημιουργική στάση που επέδειξαν εξαρχής οι Τουρκοκύπριοι, μπορεί να υπάρξει μια μόνιμη, δίκαιη και ρεαλιστική λύση, στηριγμένη στην κυριαρχική ισότητα και στο ισότιμο διεθνές καθεστώς.
Διαφορετικά, καμία λύση δεν μπορεί να οικοδομηθεί πάνω στην αδικία».

--- Summary ---
Η δήλωση της Ράνιας Θρασκιά ότι το ΠΑΣΟΚ είναι ανοιχτό σε διάλογο ακόμα και με τον Αλέξη Τσίπρα πυροδότησε αντιπαράθεση μεταξύ κυβερνητικού εκπροσώπου και αξιωματικής αντιπολίτευσης.

--- Full Text ---
Κόντρα ξέσπασε ανάμεσα στον κυβερνητικό εκπρόσωπο Παύλο Μαρινάκη και το ΠΑΣΟΚ, με αφορμή τις δηλώσεις της Ράνιας Θρασκιά για τον Αλέξη Τσίπρα.
Μιλώντας στον τηλεοπτικό σταθμό ΣΚΑΪ και την εκπομπή «Αταίριαστοι», η βουλευτής του ΠΑΣΟΚ είπε μεταξύ άλλων: «Δεν νιώθουμε ότι μας απειλεί ο κ. Τσίπρας στο ΠΑΣΟΚ», ενώ σε άλλο σημείο τόνισε: «Θεωρώ και ελπίζω πως ό,τι υπάρχει στη χώρα και εκφράζει τον προοδευτικό κόσμο πρέπει να συσπειρωθεί με αφετηρία και επικεφαλής το ΠΑΣΟΚ και να έχουμε συνομιλητές μας ανθρώπους που βρίσκονται στο προοδευτικό κομμάτι, ακόμα και τον κ. Τσίπρα».
Η συγκεκριμένη τοποθέτηση προκάλεσε την αντίδραση του κ. Μαρινάκη, ο οποίος αναρωτήθηκε αν όλοι στο ΠΑΣΟΚ συμφωνούν με την άποψη της κ. Θρασκιά.
«Αλήθεια, είναι όλοι στο ΠΑΣΟΚ σύμφωνοι με αυτές τις δηλώσεις τη στιγμή που στελέχη του στοχοποιήθηκαν από τα “παραϋπουργεία δικαιοσύνης” του κ. Τσίπρα και “κρεμάστηκαν στα μανταλάκια”;», ανέφερε χαρακτηριστικά ο κυβερνητικός εκπρόσωπος.
«Πώς νιώθουν στο κόμμα της αξιωματικής αντιπολίτευσης όσοι κράτησαν, πριν από 10 χρόνια, μαζί με τους βουλευτές της Ν.Δ., την Ελλάδα στην Ευρώπη, όταν ακούν από “συντρόφους” τους ότι εκείνος που τους κουνούσε τότε το δάχτυλο αποτελεί εν δυνάμει εταίρο τους;», αναρωτήθηκε στη συνέχεια.
Η αντίδραση του ΠΑΣΟΚ
Σε ανακοίνωσή του, το ΠΑΣΟΚ κατηγόρησε την κυβέρνηση ότι «με την έναρξη της εβδομάδας ο κυβερνητικός εκπρόσωπος έδειξε την ατζέντα της κυβέρνησης: Τσιπρολογία και άγιος ο Θεός». «Διότι», σημείωσε το ΠΑΣΟΚ, «στο σκεπτικό του Μαξίμου “με μια Ιθάκη… ξεχνιέσαι”. Πού να συζητάμε τώρα για τα καθημερινά προβλήματα, τα σκάνδαλα, το μνημόνιο στον πρωτογενή τομέα κ.ο.κ.»
Το κόμμα της αξιωματικής αντιπολίτευσης σχολίασε μάλιστα αιχμηρά ότι η κυβέρνηση αυταπατάται «αν νομίζει ότι θα αλλάξει τη δημόσια ατζέντα», καθώς «οι πολίτες έπαθαν και έμαθαν και από τον κ. Τσίπρα και από τον κ. Μητσοτάκη».
Κυβερνητικές πηγές: Πολύ δύσκολα πρέπει να είναι τα πράγματα στο ΠΑΣΟΚ
Στην επίμαχη ανακοίνωση απάντησαν κυβερνητικές πηγές, οι οποίες καταλόγισαν στο ΠΑΣΟΚ ότι δεν αφιέρωσε ούτε μία λέξη «για να απαντήσει στα ερωτήματα που του έθεσε ο κυβερνητικός εκπρόσωπος».
«Πολύ δύσκολα πρέπει να είναι τα πράγματα στο κόμμα της αξιωματικής αντιπολίτευσης», κατέληξαν οι ίδιες πηγές.

Οι ανησυχίες και ο ρόλος των τραπεζών.

--- Full Text ---
H ΕΚΤ εργάζεται συστηματικά προκειμένου να διασφαλίσει από τεχνικής πλευράς την έκδοση του ψηφιακού ευρώ διαβεβαίωσε σήμερα ο Πιέρο Τσιπολόνε, μέλος του Εκτελεστικού Συμβουλίου της Ευρωπαϊκής Κεντρικής Τράπεζας.
Οπως είπε, τελική απόφαση του Διοικητικού Συμβουλίου της ΕΚΤ σχετικά με την έκδοση ψηφιακού ευρώ θα ληφθεί μόνο μετά την έγκριση της νομοθεσίας. Αν οι Ευρωπαίοι νομοθέτες εγκρίνουν τον κανονισμό για τη θέσπιση του ψηφιακού ευρώ μέσα στο 2026, η πιλοτική εφαρμογή και οι πρώτες συναλλαγές θα είναι εφικτές από τα μέσα του 2027, ενώ το ψηφιακό ευρώ θα μπορούσε να είναι έτοιμο για πρώτη έκδοση το 2029.
Οπως δήλωσε, οι καταναλωτές, οι έμποροι και οι τράπεζες «θα επωφεληθούν όλοι», ενώ η μείωση της εξάρτησης από παρόχους εκτός Ευρώπης θα ενισχύσει επίσης την ανθεκτικότητα, την αυτονομία και την οικονομική ασφάλεια της ηπείρου.
Ο Τσιπολόνε δεν συμμερίστηκε τις ανησυχίες που έχουν εκφραστεί από την πλευρά των τραπεζών για αύξηση του κόστους συναλλαγών με την έλευση του ψηφιακού ευρώ, αναφέροντας ότι επί του παρόντος οι ευρωπαϊκές τράπεζες ήδη χάνουν προμήθειες από τα διεθνή συστήματα καρτών και πληρωμών. Με το ψηφιακό ευρώ, όπως τόνισε, «το μοντέλο αποζημίωσης θα διασφαλίσει ότι οι τράπεζες θα επωφελούνται».
«Το ψηφιακό ευρώ θα παρέχει μια ψηφιακή μορφή μετρητών που θα συμπληρώνει τα τραπεζογραμμάτια και τα κέρματα με τα οποία είμαστε εξοικειωμένοι, εξασφαλίζοντας έτσι ότι οι πληρωμές -τόσο οι φυσικές όσο και οι ψηφιακές- θα συνεχίσουν να λειτουργούν ανά πάσα στιγμή, χωρίς να εξαρτώνται από αποφάσεις που λαμβάνονται εκτός Ευρώπης.
Το ψηφιακό ευρώ θα είναι μια ευρωπαϊκή λύση ψηφιακών πληρωμών που θα βασίζεται σε ευρωπαϊκή υποδομή – όλοι οι πάροχοι που έχουμε επιλέξει είναι εντός Ε.Ε. και ελέγχονται από υπηκόους της Ε.Ε.».
Κατά τον ίδιο, η εφαμοργή του μέτρου θα προστατεύσει τη νομισματική κυριαρχία ακόμη και με την επέκταση των σταθερών νομισμάτων «τα οποία επί του παρόντος είναι κυρίως εκφρασμένα σε ξένα νομίσματα – και των κρυπτονομισμάτων χωρίς αντίκρισμα», ανέφερε o κ. Τσιπολόνε.

Ρεκόρ αιτήσεων καταγράφει η πλατφόρμα της ΑΑΔΕ για το επίδομα θέρμανσης. Οι παγίδες και τα λάθη που στοιχίζουν την ενίσχυση.
Τις 550.000 έχουν ξεπεράσει οι αιτήσεις των δικαιούχων επιδόματος θέρμανσης μέσω της πλατφόρμας myΘέρμανση, σε μόλις μια εβδομάδα.
Αν και η προθεσμία λήγει στις 5 Δεκεμβρίου, περίπου το 50% των δυνητικά δικαιούχων έχει σπεύσει να «κλειδώσει» το επίδομα, ανεξαρτήτως του ποσού που δικαιούται, εξέλιξη η οποία αντικατοπτρίζει τη μεγάλη ανάγκη των πολιτών για οικονομική ενίσχυση ενόψει του χειμώνα.
Όπως προκύπτει από τα στοιχεία της ΑΑΔΕ , περίπου το 70% των αιτήσεων αφορά την επιδότηση για πετρέλαιο θέρμανσης , την πιο διαδεδομένη μορφή ενίσχυσης.
Το επίδομα κυμαίνεται από 100 έως 800 ευρώ και μπορεί να φτάσει έως 1.200 ευρώ για όσους κατοικούν σε περιοχές με πολύ χαμηλές θερμοκρασίες. Η προκαταβολή του επιδόματος φθάνει το 60% του ποσού που έλαβαν οι δικαιούχοι για τη σεζόν 2024-2025 και θα πιστωθεί στους τραπεζικούς λογαριασμούς πριν τα Χριστούγεννα.
Αν και η διαδικασία υποβολής της αίτησης είναι απλή, υπάρχουν «παγίδες» που πρέπει να προσέξουν οι ενδιαφερόμενοι, διαφορετικά κινδυνεύουν να χάσουν το επίδομα.
Τα πιο συχνά λάθη που κάνουν ιδιοκτήτες ή ενοικιαστές και μπορεί να τους κοστίσουν το επίδομα είναι τα εξής:
*Έγγαμοι δηλώνουν ΙΒΑΝ στο όνομα του άλλου συζύγου από εκείνον που υπέβαλε την αίτηση. Θα πρέπει να δηλωθεί ο αριθμός ΙΒΑΝ που ανήκει στο πρόσωπο το οποίο έχει υποβάλει την αίτηση στην πλατφόρμα myΘέρμανση. Η δήλωση του ΙΒΑΝ πρέπει να έχει γίνει πριν την οριστικοποίηση της αίτησης, στην πλατφόρμα «Δήλωση Λογαριασμού IBAN» της ψηφιακής πύλης myAADE της ΑΑΔΕ.
*Στα παραστατικά αγοράς πετρελαίου αναγράφεται ο ΑΦΜ της συζύγου (ή το αντίστροφο) και όχι του δικαιούχου που υποβάλλει την αίτηση για το επίδομα θέρμανσης. Στην περίπτωση αυτή, δεν θα ολοκληρωθεί η διασταύρωση των στοιχείων και η αίτηση θα «κολλήσει». Για να λυθεί το και να ολοκληρωθεί η διασταύρωση των αγορών πετρελαίου θέρμανσης θα πρέπει οι δικαιούχοι να προχωρήσουν εγκαίρως σε μία μόνο από τις δύο παρακάτω ενέργειες:
α) πριν την λήξη της προθεσμίας υποβολής αιτήσεων (5 Δεκεμβρίου 2025), να κάνουν ανάκληση της αίτησης σας και να υποβάλει εκ νέου αίτηση η/ο σύζυγος σας με τους δικούς της/του TAXISnet κωδικούς.
β) αν δεν έχουν περάσει 14 ημέρες από την ημερομηνία αγοράς του πετρελαίου θέρμανσης, μπορούν να ζητήσουν από τον προμηθευτή (πρατηριούχο) να αλλάξει τον ΑΦΜ αγοραστή και να δηλώσει της/του συζύγου.
*Πρόβλημα παρατηρείται και σε διπλοκατοικίες με κοινό «ρολόι» παροχής ρεύματος , ή όταν στα παραστατικά αγοράς πετρελαίου θέρμανσης αναγράφεται διαφορετικό ΑΦΜ από το ΑΦΜ του προσώπου που υπέβαλε την αίτηση στην πλατφόρμα myΘέρμανση. Η επιδότηση χάνεται, αν δεν γίνουν εγκαίρως διορθώσεις.
*Νοικοκυριά που είναι δικαιούχοι του Κοινωνικού Οικιακού Τιμολογίου (ΚΟΤ) υποβάλουν αίτηση για να λάβουν επίδομα θέρμανσης στον ηλεκτρισμό. Η αίτησή τους απορρίπτεται καθώς δεν δικαιούνται επίδομα για το ηλεκτρικό ρεύμα που χρησιμοποιούν για να ζεστάνουν το σπίτι τους. Εάν θέλουν να λάβουν το επίδομα θα πρέπει να υποβάλουν αίτηση για άλλο καύσιμο π.χ. πετρέλαιο θέρμανσης.

Ο πρόεδρος της Δημοκρατίας κατέθεσε στεφάνι στο μνημείο για την εξέγερση του Πολυτεχνείου. Το μήνυμά του για την επέτειο.
Στο μήνυμά του για τη σημερινή επέτειο της εξέγερσης του Πολυτεχνείου, ο Πρόεδρος της Δημοκρατίας, Κωνσταντίνος Τασούλας , υπογράμμισε ότι η εξέγερση του 1973 αποτελεί « υπεύθυνη, λαϊκή και διαρκής διεκδίκηση της δημοκρατίας και της ελευθερίας », μέσα σε συνθήκες δικτατορίας και αυταρχισμού.
Όπως τόνισε, 52 χρόνια μετά, το μήνυμα του Πολυτεχνείου αφορά στην « υπεύθυνη λαϊκή και διαρκή προστασία της ελευθερίας και της δημοκρατίας μέσα σε συνθήκες κοινοβουλευτισμού». Αυτό συνιστά συνταγματική επιταγή και αποδεικνύει ότι η δημοκρατία παραμένει «το καλύτερο από τα εφικτά πολιτεύματα », όταν οι πολίτες συμφωνούν στη διαφύλαξή της.
Ο Πρόεδρος της Δημοκρατίας σημείωσε ότι η σημερινή ημέρα αποτελεί υπενθύμιση του χρέους απέναντι στο «ευαίσθητο πολίτευμα της Δημοκρατίας», ενώ παράλληλα προσφέρει αφορμή για αναζήτηση κοινών τόπων και κοινών αληθειών, με πίστη σε όσα ενώνουν την κοινωνία και το έθνος.
Αναφερόμενος στο ιστορικό σύνθημα «Ψωμί, Παιδεία, Ελευθερία», το χαρακτήρισε «φωνή που ταρακούνησε τη δικτατορία», επισημαίνοντας ότι σήμερα μετατρέπεται σε χρέος για μια δημοκρατική πολιτεία με προκοπή, μόρφωση και στέρεους θεσμούς.
Κλείνοντας, υπογράμμισε ότι όσο πολίτες και ηγεσία παραμένουν ενωμένοι και προσηλωμένοι σε αυτό το καθήκον, «η πατρίδα θα πηγαίνει μπροστά», δικαιώνοντας το Πολυτεχνείο και διαφυλάσσοντας τη δημοκρατία από τις απειλές που αντιμετωπίζει.
Αξίζει να σημειωθεί πως νωρίτερα ο κ. Τασούλας κατέθεσε στεφάνι στο μνημείο για την εξέγερση του Πολυτεχνείου.
Αναλυτικά η δήλωση του Κ. Τασούλα:
« Το Πολυτεχνείο είναι η υπεύθυνη, λαϊκή και γενναία διεκδίκηση της Δημοκρατίας και της Ελευθερίας.
Μέσα σε συνθήκες δικτατορίας και αυταρχισμού.
Το μήνυμα του Πολυτεχνείου σήμερα, 52 χρόνια μετά, είναι η υπεύθυνη, λαϊκή και διαρκής προστασία της ελευθερίας και της δημοκρατίας μέσα σε συνθήκες κοινοβουλευτισμού.
Αυτό επιτάσσει το Σύνταγμα. Αυτό αποδεικνύει ότι η δημοκρατία είναι το καλύτερο από τα εφικτά πολιτεύματα, όταν οι πολίτες συμφωνούν στην διαφύλαξη του.
Σήμερα, τιμώντας το Πολυτεχνείο και όσους αψήφησαν ακόμη και τη ζωή τους γι΄ αυτό, αναμετριόμαστε με το χρέος μας απέναντι στο ευαίσθητο πολίτευμα της Δημοκρατίας και αναζητούμε κοινούς τόπους και κοινές αλήθειες. Με πίστη σε όσα μας ενώνουν ως κοινωνία και ως έθνος.
Η φωνή του Πολυτεχνείου που ταρακούνησε τη δικτατορία «Ψωμί, παιδεία, ελευθερία» γίνεται σήμερα χρέος για τη δημοκρατική πολιτεία, για προκοπή, μόρφωση και στέρεους θεσμούς.
Και όσο εμείς ως λαός και ηγεσία είμαστε ενωμένοι και προσηλωμένοι σε αυτό το χρέος, τόσο η πατρίδα μας θα πηγαίνει μπροστά, δικαιώνοντας το Πολυτεχνείο και διαφυλάσσοντας τη δημοκρατία από τις κακοτοπιές που την απειλούν. »

Ο Νίκος Ανδρουλάκης τονίζει ότι το μήνυμα του Πολυτεχνείου παραμένει επίκαιρο απέναντι σε αυταρχισμό και ανισότητες.
« Σήμερα τιμούμε εκείνες και εκείνους, που δεν λύγισαν . Κρατάμε ζωντανό το μήνυμα του Πολυτεχνείου: Ενότητα και αγώνας για δημοκρατία, δικαιοσύνη, λαϊκή συμμετοχή, αξιοπρέπεια», δήλωσε ο Νίκος Ανδρουλάκης , για την 52η επέτειο της εξέγερσης του Πολυτεχνείου.
Ο πρόεδρος του ΠΑΣΟΚ-Κινήματος Αλλαγής συμπλήρωσε πως σε «μια εποχή που οι εχθροί της Δημοκρατίας, είναι πολλοί -ορατοί και αδιόρατοι-, στα χρόνια που έρχονται το Πολυτεχνείο θα γίνεται όλο και πιο επίκαιρο».
Υπογράμμισε ακόμη πως «απέναντι στον αυταρχισμό και τις ανισότητες, στεκόμαστε όρθιοι για να μην επιτρέψουμε ποτέ ξανά να σβήσει η φωνή της ελευθερίας , της προόδου και της πίστης σε έναν δικαιότερο κόσμο».
Ο κ. Ανδρουλάκης σημείωσε ότι 52 χρόνια πριν, η κεντρική πύλη του Πολυτεχνείου καταρρέει από την ορμή του τανκ, κι εκεί όπου η σιδερένια πόρτα έπεσε, γράφει ο Γιάννης Ρίτσος, «είναι μια κόκκινη λίμνη, ένα κόκκινο δέντρο, ένα κόκκινο πουλί».
«Μέσα από τον κρότο της βίας, υψώνεται κάτι αθάνατο: το πάθος για δημοκρατία. Η νεολαία στάθηκε απέναντι στον φόβο, με μόνο της όπλο το όραμα για μια ελεύθερη Ελλάδα», επισήμανε ο πρόεδρος του ΠΑΣΟΚ-Κινήματος Αλλαγής.

Τα έσοδα από φόρους προ επιστροφών ανήλθαν σε 59.322 εκατ. ευρώ, αυξημένα κατά 2.083 εκατ. ευρώ ή 3,6% έναντι του στόχου
Σύμφωνα με τα στοιχεία εκτέλεσης του κρατικού προϋπολογισμού, σε τροποποιημένη ταμειακή βάση, για την περίοδο του Ιανουαρίου – Οκτωβρίου 2025, παρουσιάζεται πλεόνασμα στο ισοζύγιο του κρατικού προϋπολογισμού ύψους 3.087 εκατ. ευρώ έναντι του στόχου για πλεόνασμα 212 εκατ. ευρώ που έχει περιληφθεί για το αντίστοιχο διάστημα του 2025 στην εισηγητική έκθεση του Προϋπολογισμού 2025 και πλεονάσματος 6.116 εκατ. ευρώ το αντίστοιχο διάστημα του 2024.
Το πρωτογενές αποτέλεσμα σε τροποποιημένη ταμειακή βάση διαμορφώθηκε σε πλεόνασμα ύψους 10.298 εκατ. ευρώ, έναντι στόχου για πρωτογενές πλεόνασμα 7.192 εκατ. ευρώ και πρωτογενούς πλεονάσματος 13.528 εκατ. ευρώ για την ίδια περίοδο το 2024. Σημειώνεται ότι ποσό 2.542 εκατ. ευρώ που αφορά σε ετεροχρονισμό μεταβιβαστικών πληρωμών του τακτικού προϋπολογισμού και ποσό 904 εκατ. ευρώ που αφορά σε ετεροχρονισμό των πληρωμών των εξοπλιστικών προγραμμάτων, δεν επηρεάζουν το αποτέλεσμα της Γενικής Κυβέρνησης σε δημοσιονομικούς όρους. Επιπλέον, στο στόχο του Οκτωβρίου είχε προβλεφθεί ποσό ύψους 2.109 εκατ. ευρώ που αφορά την είσπραξη της έκτης δόσης του Ταμείου Ανάκαμψης και Ανθεκτικότητας, το οποίο αναμένεται να εισπραχθεί το αμέσως επόμενο χρονικό διάστημα πριν το τέλος του έτους. Επιπροσθέτως, ποσό ύψους 342 εκατ. ευρώ φορολογικών εσόδων του πρώτου διμήνου προσμετράται δημοσιονομικά στο έτος 2024. Εξαιρώντας τα ανωτέρω ποσά, η υπέρβαση στο πρωτογενές αποτέλεσμα σε τροποποιημένη ταμειακή βάση, έναντι των στόχων του προϋπολογισμού, εκτιμάται σε 1.427 εκατ. ευρώ.
Επισημαίνεται ότι το πρωτογενές αποτέλεσμα σε δημοσιονομικούς όρους διαφέρει από το αποτέλεσμα σε ταμειακούς όρους. Επιπρόσθετα, τα ανωτέρω αφορούν στο πρωτογενές αποτέλεσμα της Κεντρικής Διοίκησης και όχι στο σύνολο της Γενικής Κυβέρνησης, που περιλαμβάνει και τα δημοσιονομικά αποτελέσματα των Νομικών Προσώπων και των υποτομέων των ΟΤΑ και ΟΚΑ.
Την περίοδο Ιανουαρίου – Οκτωβρίου 2025, το ύψος των καθαρών εσόδων του κρατικού προϋπολογισμού ανήλθε σε 60.957 εκατ. ευρώ , παρουσιάζοντας μείωση κατά 1.681 εκατ. ευρώ ή 2,7% έναντι του στόχου που έχει περιληφθεί για το αντίστοιχο διάστημα στην εισηγητική έκθεση του Προϋπολογισμού 2025.
Σημειώνεται ότι στο ύψος των καθαρών εσόδων εμπεριέχεται, τόσο στα έσοδα (στην κατηγορία «Πωλήσεις αγαθών και υπηρεσιών»), όσο και στις επιστροφές φόρων (ΦΠΑ), το ποσό των 784,8 εκατ. ευρώ από τις συναλλαγές που απαιτήθηκε να γίνουν κατά τον μήνα Ιανουάριο 2025 για την ολοκλήρωση της νέας Σύμβασης Παραχώρησης της Αττικής Οδού, οι οποίες αφορούν στο έτος 2024 και είναι δημοσιονομικά ουδέτερες.
Η μείωση των καθαρών εσόδων έναντι του στόχου οφείλεται στο γεγονός ότι, στη στοχοθεσία της εισηγητικής έκθεσης για το δεκάμηνο Ιανουαρίου-Οκτωβρίου 2025 είχαν συμπεριληφθεί:
α) η είσπραξη τον μήνα Ιούνιο του τιμήματος ύψους 1.350 εκατ. ευρώ από τη Σύμβαση Παραχώρησης υπηρεσιών για τη χρηματοδότηση, λειτουργία, συντήρηση και εκμετάλλευση του αυτοκινητοδρόμου της Εγνατίας Οδού και των τριών (3) κάθετων οδικών αξόνων, η οποία υπογράφηκε στις 29 Μαρτίου 2024, μεταξύ αφενός του Ελληνικού Δημοσίου και του ΤΑΙΠΕΔ (νυν ΕΕΣΥΠ) και αφετέρου της εταιρείας «ΝΕΑ ΕΓΝΑΤΙΑ ΟΔΟΣ Α.Ε» ως Παραχωρησιούχου. Τα επόμενα βήματα της διαδικασίας έως την καταβολή του τιμήματος αναμένεται να ολοκληρωθούν τους επόμενους μήνες και
β) η είσπραξη τον μήνα Οκτώβριο της έκτης δόσης από το Ταμείο Ανάκαμψης και Ανθεκτικότητας (ΤΑΑ), ποσού ύψους 2.109 εκατ. ευρώ, το οποίο αναμένεται να εισπραχθεί το αμέσως επόμενο χρονικό διάστημα πριν το τέλος του έτους.
Εξαιρουμένων των ανωτέρω ποσών, τα καθαρά έσοδα παρουσιάζουν αύξηση κατά 1.778 εκατ. ευρώ ή 3% έναντι του στόχου , εξαιτίας κυρίως των αυξημένων φορολογικών εσόδων.
Τα έσοδα από φόρους προ επιστροφών ανήλθαν σε 59.322 εκατ. ευρώ, αυξημένα κατά 2.083 εκατ. ευρώ ή 3,6% έναντι του στόχου, κυρίως εξαιτίας της καλύτερης απόδοσης στην είσπραξη των φόρων του τρέχοντος έτους (φόροι εισοδήματος, ΦΠΑ, ειδικοί φόροι κατανάλωσης κ.λπ.) όσο και από την καλύτερη απόδοση των φόρων εισοδήματος του προηγούμενου έτους που εισπράχθηκαν σε δόσεις μέχρι και το τέλος Φεβρουαρίου 2025. Σημειώνεται ότι τα ανωτέρω αφορούν τη σύγκριση σε σχέση με τους στόχους του Προϋπολογισμού, ενώ κατά την κατάρτιση του Προσχεδίου του Κρατικού Προϋπολογισμού 2026 επικαιροποιήθηκαν οι σχετικές εκτιμήσεις, λαμβάνοντας υπόψη την εκτέλεση των εσόδων.
Οι επιστροφές εσόδων ανήλθαν σε 7.318 εκατ. ευρώ και ενσωματώνουν το ποσό επιστροφής ΦΠΑ ύψους 784,8 εκατ. ευρώ από τη νέα Σύμβαση Παραχώρησης της Αττικής Οδού, όπως προαναφέρθηκε, το οποίο δημοσιονομικά επηρεάζει το έτος 2024. Αν εξαιρεθεί το ποσό αυτό, οι επιστροφές φόρων ανήλθαν σε 6.533 εκατ. ευρώ και είναι αυξημένες κατά 279 εκατ. ευρώ έναντι του στόχου (6.254 εκατ. ευρώ), που έχει περιληφθεί στην εισηγητική έκθεση του Προϋπολογισμού 2025.
Λαμβάνοντας υπόψη τα ανωτέρω, τα καθαρά έσοδα από φόρους μετά επιστροφών την περίοδο Ιανουαρίου – Οκτωβρίου 2025 εμφανίζονται αυξημένα κατά 1.804 εκατ. ευρώ έναντι του στόχου του Προϋπολογισμού.Όπως προαναφέρθηκε, ποσό ύψους 342 εκατ. ευρώ φορολογικών εσόδων του πρώτου διμήνου προσμετράται δημοσιονομικά στο έτος 2024.
Τα έσοδα του ΠΔΕ ανήλθαν σε 2.930 εκατ. ευρώ, μειωμένα κατά 615 εκατ. ευρώ από τον στόχο (3.545 εκατ. ευρώ), που έχει περιληφθεί στην εισηγητική έκθεση του Προϋπολογισμού 2025.
Η ακριβής κατανομή μεταξύ των κατηγοριών εσόδων του κρατικού προϋπολογισμού θα πραγματοποιηθεί με την έκδοση του οριστικού δελτίου.
Ειδικότερα, τον Οκτώβριο 2025 το σύνολο των καθαρών εσόδων του κρατικού προϋπολογισμού ανήλθε στα 6.296 εκατ. ευρώ, μειωμένο κατά 2.238 εκατ. ευρώ έναντι του μηνιαίου στόχου εξαιτίας του γεγονότος ότι στη στοχοθεσία της εισηγητικής έκθεσης είχε συμπεριληφθεί η είσπραξη τον μήνα Οκτώβριο της έκτης δόσης από το Ταμείο Ανάκαμψης και Ανθεκτικότητας, ποσού ύψους 2.109 εκατ. ευρώ, η οποία αναμένεται να εισπραχθεί το αμέσως επόμενο χρονικό διάστημα πριν το τέλος του έτους, όπως προαναφέρθηκε.
Τα έσοδα από φόρους προ επιστροφών ανήλθαν σε 6.600 εκατ. ευρώ, μειωμένα κατά 6 εκατ. ευρώ ή 0,1% έναντι του στόχου.
Οι επιστροφές εσόδων ανήλθαν σε 609 εκατ. ευρώ, μειωμένες κατά 20 εκατ. ευρώ από τον μηνιαίο στόχο (629 εκατ. ευρώ).
Τα έσοδα του ΠΔΕ ανήλθαν σε 56 εκατ. ευρώ, μειωμένα κατά 44 εκατ. ευρώ από τον στόχο (100 εκατ. ευρώ).
Οι δαπάνες του Κρατικού Προϋπολογισμού για την περίοδο του Ιανουαρίου – Οκτωβρίου 2025 ανήλθαν στα 57.871 εκατ. ευρώ και παρουσιάζονται μειωμένες κατά 4.556 εκατ. ευρώ έναντι του στόχου (62.426 εκατ. ευρώ), που έχει περιληφθεί στην εισηγητική έκθεση του Προϋπολογισμού 2025. Επίσης, είναι αυξημένες σε σχέση με την αντίστοιχη περίοδο του 2024 κατά 2.656 εκατ. ευρώ.
Στο σκέλος του Τακτικού Προϋπολογισμού οι πληρωμές παρουσιάζονται μειωμένες έναντι του στόχου κατά 4.157 εκατ. ευρώ, γεγονός που οφείλεται κυρίως στον ετεροχρονισμό των μεταβιβαστικών πληρωμών προς τους ΟΚΑ και λοιπούς φορείς γενικής κυβέρνησης κατά 2.542 εκατ. ευρώ και των ταμειακών πληρωμών των εξοπλιστικών προγραμμάτων κατά 904 εκατ. ευρώ. Σημειώνεται ότι τα προαναφερθέντα ποσά δεν επηρεάζουν το αποτέλεσμα της Γενικής Κυβέρνησης σε δημοσιονομικούς όρους.
Αξιοσημείωτες μεταβιβάσεις είναι οι ακόλουθες:
Οι πληρωμές στο σκέλος των επενδυτικών δαπανών ανήλθαν στα 9.338 εκατ. ευρώ, μειωμένες κατά 399 εκατ. ευρώ σε σχέση με τον στόχο, που έχει περιληφθεί στην εισηγητική έκθεση του Προϋπολογισμού 2025. Ταυτόχρονα παρουσιάζονται αυξημένες σε σχέση με τις αντίστοιχες πληρωμές του 2024 κατά 955 εκατ. ευρώ. Ειδικότερα, οι δαπάνες του Ταμείου Ανάκαμψης και Ανθεκτικότητας την περίοδο Ιανουαρίου-Οκτωβρίου 2025 ανήλθαν σε 3.054 εκατ. ευρώ, παρουσιάζοντας αύξηση κατά 257 εκατ. ευρώ έναντι του στόχου.

Title       : Κομισιόν για Ελλάδα: Ανάπτυξη 2,2% το 2026, υποχώρηση από το 2027 - Το σήμα για τις αγροτικές επιδόσεις

--- Summary ---
Η Κομισιόν σημειώνει πως αναμένονται επιπλέον πιέσεις από υψηλότερες δαπάνες για την υγεία και την άμυνα, καθώς και μια «δημοσιονομική διόρθωση που σχετίζεται με τις αγροτικές επιδοτήσεις της ΕΕ, ισοδύναμη με 0,2% του ΑΕΠ» ή περίπου 473 εκατ. ευρώ σε τιμές 2024.

Η Κομισιόν σημειώνει πως αναμένονται επιπλέον πιέσεις από υψηλότερες δαπάνες για την υγεία και την άμυνα, καθώς και μια «δημοσιονομική διόρθωση που σχετίζεται με τις αγροτικές επιδοτήσεις της ΕΕ, ισοδύναμη με 0,2% του ΑΕΠ» ή περίπου 473 εκατ. ευρώ σε τιμές 2024.
Με αυξητικό ρυθμο  2,1% αναμένεται να κινηθεί για το 2025 η ελληνική οικονομία με βάση τις φθινοπωρινές προβλέψεις της Κομισιόν που δημοσιεύτηκαν τη Δευτέρα (17/11). Για το 2026 αναμένει μια επιβράδυνση της ανάπτυξης στο  2,2% και στο  1,7% για το 2027 ένεκα και της ολοκλήρωσης του Ταμείου Ανάκαμψης. Το δημόσιο χρέος αναμένεται να υποχωρήσει στο 137% του ΑΕΠ.
Κινητήριοι μοχλοί της ανάπτυξης θα είναι η κατανάλωση και οι επενδύσεις που στηρίζονται από τα ευρωπαϊκά κονδύλια.
Ο εναρμονισμένος πληθωρισμός αναμένεται να μειωθεί σταδιακά από το 2,8% το 2025 στο 2,3% το 2026 και να φτάσει το 2,4% το 2027 καθώς η ισχυρή ζήτηση και η προβλεπόμενη αύξηση των τιμών ενέργειας θα ασκήσουν ανοδικές πιέσεις. Η ανεργία αναμένεται να συνεχίζει να μειώνεται σε επίπεδα που είχαν να εμφανιστούν για περισσότερο από μία δεκαετία και φθάνοντας το 8,2% το 2027, ωστόσο όπως σημειώνει η Ευρωπαϊκή Επιτροπή εξακολουθούν να υφίστανται διαρθρωτικές προκλήσεις.
«Οι δημοσιονομικές προοπτικές της Ελλάδας παραμένουν ευνοϊκές κατά την περίοδο 2025-2027, διατηρώντας σε γενικές γραμμές σταθερά πρωτογενή πλεονάσματα, παρά τις μειώσεις φόρων  και τα μέτρα κοινωνικής πολιτικής. Η Κομισιόν σημειώνει πως αναμένονται επιπλέον πιέσεις από υψηλότερες δαπάνες για την υγεία και την άμυνα, καθώς και μια «δημοσιονομική διόρθωση που σχετίζεται με τις αγροτικές επιδοτήσεις της ΕΕ, ισοδύναμη με 0,2% του ΑΕΠ» ή περίπου 473 εκατ. ευρώ σε τιμές 2024 για την οποία δεν διευκρινίζεται αν πρόκειται για το πρόστιμο που επιβλήθηκε στη χώρα μας το περασμένο καλοκαίρι ή για κάποια επιπλέον πρόβλεψη.
Η ισχυρή ονομαστική ανάπτυξη του ΑΕΠ και τα πλεονάσματα του προϋπολογισμού αναμένεται να διατηρήσουν τον δείκτη χρέους προς ΑΕΠ σε πτωτική πορεία , κινούμενος κάτω από το 140% έως το 2027 », αναφέρει η Κομισιόν.
Οι νέες προβλέψεις της Κομισιόν είναι ελαφρώς χειρότερες για την πορεία της οικονομίας το 2025 σε σχέση με τις εαρινές προβλέψεις που έβλεπε ανάπτυξη 2,3% φέτος. Ωστόσο παραμένει σταθερή η πρόβλεψη για ανάπτυξη 2,2% το 2026. Την ίδια ώρα η Ευρωπαϊκή Επιτροπή αναθεώρησε σημαντικά προς τα πάνω τις εκτιμήσεις της για την πορεία της οικονομίας στην Ευρωζώνη και στην Ευρωπαϊκή Ένωση καθώς η πορεία των πρώτων εννέα μηνών ξεπέρασε τις προσδοκίες.
Έτσι πλέον η Ευρωπαϊκή Επιτροπή προβλέπει ανάπτυξη 1,4% για την ΕΕ το 2025 και το 2026 και 1,5% για το 2027. Αναθεωρημένες προς τα πάνω είναι και η εκτιμήσεις για την οικονομία της Ευρωζώνης που αναμένεται να κινηθεί προς τα πάνω με ρυθμούς 1,3% το 2025, 1,2% το 2025 και 1,4% το 2027.
Συνολικά, σημειώνει η Κομισιόν, η ελληνική οικονομία αναμένεται να διατηρήσει την αναπτυξιακή της δυναμική το δεύτερο εξάμηνο του 2025 και καθ’ όλη τη διάρκεια του 2026. Και αυτό διότι η επενδυτική δραστηριότητα προβλέπεται να παραμείνει ισχυρήυποστηριζόμενη από τη διψήφια ανάπτυξη των δανειοδοτήσεων προς τις επιχειρήσεις και την εφαρμογή του Σχεδίου Ανάκαμψης και Ανθεκτικότητας. Επιπλέον, οι αλλαγές στη φορολογία που θα ισχύσουν από το 2026 αναμένονται να ενισχύσουν την αύξηση των καθαρών μισθών και κατά συνέπεια την ιδιωτική κατανάλωση. Η ζήτηση για εισαγωγές προβλέπεται να παραμείνει ισχυρή, δεδομένων των νέων επενδύσεων.
«Ενώ η οικονομία έχει επιδείξει μέχρι στιγμής ανθεκτικότητα στις εξωτερικές προκλήσεις, μια παρατεταμένη αύξηση της γεωπολιτικής ή εμπορικής αβεβαιότητας και του κόστους χρηματοδότησης θα μπορούσε να επιβαρύνει σημαντικά τις εξαγωγές, ιδίως στον τουριστικό τομέα, και την επενδυτική δραστηριότητα», αναφέρει η εκτίμηση της Ευρωπαϊκής Επιτροπής.
Η Κομισιόν σημειώνει πως αν και δεν αναμένεται απότομη επιβράδυνση, η ανάπτυξη προβλέπεται να επιβραδυνθεί μετά το 2026, καθώς η εφαρμογή του Ταμείο Ανάκαμψης ολοκληρώνεται. Η αύξηση του ΑΕΠ προβλέπεται να είναι σχετικά σταθερή , με ρυθμούς 2,1% το 2025 και 2,2% το 2026 , πριν μετριαστεί στο 1,7% το 2027 .
Η ανεργία μειώθηκε στο 8,2% τον Οκτώβριο του 2025, το χαμηλότερο επίπεδό της από το 2009, ωστόσο παραμένει πάνω από τον μέσο όρο της ΕΕ. Ο αριθμός των κενών θέσεων εργασίας έχει υποχωρήσει ελαφρώς, παραμένουν όμως υψηλά δείχνοντας μια σχετικά σφιχτή αγορά εργασίας, ιδιαίτερα στους τομείς του τουρισμού και των κατασκευών.
Σύμφωνα με την Κομισιόν, η απασχόληση θα συνεχίσει να αυξάνεται, αν και με βραδύτερο ρυθμό λόγω των διαρθρωτικών προβλημάτων της ελληνικής αγοράς εργασίας, όπως τα κενό δεξιοτήτων και τα χαμηλά ποσοστά συμμετοχής, ειδικά μεταξύ των γυναικών.
Οι μισθοί ανά εργαζόμενο αναμένεται να αυξηθούν, με μέσο ετήσιο ρυθμό ανάπτυξης 3,6% κατά την περίοδο πρόβλεψης, κάτι που οφείλεται εν μέρει σε προηγούμενες αυξήσεις του κατώτατου μισθού, στη μείωση των ασφαλιστικών εισφορών και στη μείωση του φόρου εισοδήματος φυσικών προσώπων.
Αφού διαμορφώθηκε κατά μέσο όρο στο 3,1% το πρώτο εξάμηνο του 2025, ο πληθωρισμός μειώθηκε στο 1,7% έως τον Οκτώβριο, λόγω της μείωσης του πληθωρισμού στις τιμές ενέργειας και υπηρεσιών. Ωστόσο, η ισχυρή ζήτηση και η ακόμη σφιχτή αγορά εργασίας αναμένεται να διατηρήσουν ανοδικές πιέσεις στις τιμές καταναλωτή.
Ως αποτέλεσμα, ο πληθωρισμός προβλέπεται να αποκλιμακωθεί με αργούς ρυθμούς, φτάνοντας στο 2,8% το 2025 και στο 2,3% το 2026. Ενώ ο γενικός πληθωρισμός εξαιρουμένης της ενέργειας και των τροφίμων αναμένεται να μετριαστεί, η προβλεπόμενη αύξηση των τιμών ενέργειας αναμένεται να διατηρήσει τον πληθωρισμό στο 2,4% το 2027.
Η Ελλάδα διατηρεί «μια σταθερή δημοσιονομική θέση» παρά τα μέτρα που λαμβάνει για την φορολογία σημειώνει η Ευρωπαϊκή Επιτροπή. Το πλεόνασμα γενικής κυβέρνησης αναμένεται να μειωθεί από το 1,2% του ΑΕΠ το 2024 στο περίπου 1,1% του ΑΕΠ το 2022 λόγω μιας αναμενόμενης μείωσης του πρωτογενούς
Το πρωτογενές πλεόνασμα της Γενικής Κυβέρνησης αναμένεται να μειωθεί από 1,2% του ΑΕΠ το 2024 σε περίπου 1,1% το 2025. Αυτό αντικατοπτρίζει μια μείωση του πρωτογενούς πλεονάσματος από 4,7% σε 4,3%, η οποία αντισταθμίζεται εν μέρει από μειωμένες δαπάνες τόκων.
Η μείωση του πρωτογενούς πλεονάσματος προέρχεται κυρίως από επεκτατικά μέτρα (0,7% του ΑΕΠ), συμπεριλαμβανομένης της μείωσης των ασφαλιστικών εισφορών κατά 1 ποσοστιαία μονάδα (π.μ.), των υψηλότερων μισθών του δημόσιου τομέα, της επιδότησης ενοικίου με εισοδηματικά κριτήρια και ενός μόνιμου ετήσιου επιδόματος 250 ευρώ για χαμηλοσυνταξιούχους και ευάλωτα άτομα.
Πρόσθετες πιέσεις περιλαμβάνουν υψηλότερες δαπάνες για την υγεία και την άμυνα, καθώς και μια «δημοσιονομική διόρθωση που σχετίζεται με τις αγροτικές επιδοτήσεις της ΕΕ, ισοδύναμη με 0,2% του ΑΕΠ».
Αυτά τα αποτελέσματα αντισταθμίζονται εν μέρει από την αυξημένη είσπραξη εσόδων, η οποία υποστηρίζεται από τα εν εξελίξει μέτρα φορολογικής συμμόρφωσης, την επέκταση της ψηφιακής κάρτας εργασίας σε νέους τομείς για τη μείωση της αδήλωτης εργασίας, και τα υψηλότερα τέλη τοπικής αυτοδιοίκησης.
Το 2026, το ισοζύγιο του προϋπολογισμού προβλέπεται να φτάσει στο 0,3%, καταγράφοντας μείωση κατά 0,8 π.μ. σε σύγκριση με το 2025. Αυτό αντιστοιχεί σε πρωτογενές πλεόνασμα 3,4% του ΑΕΠ.
Αυτή η μείωση αντικατοπτρίζει κυρίως ένα πρόσφατα ανακοινωθέν επεκτατικό δημοσιονομικό πακέτο, το οποίο εκτιμάται ότι θα κοστίσει 0,6% του ΑΕΠ το 2026 και 0,8% του ΑΕΠ το 2027.
Η πρόβλεψη περιλαμβάνει επίσης υψηλότερες αμυντικές δαπάνες, οι οποίες αναμένεται να αυξηθούν από 2,4% του ΑΕΠ το 2025 σε 2,6% το 2026.
Το 2027, το πρωτογενές ισοζύγιο προβλέπεται να μειωθεί στο 0,0% του ΑΕΠ, αντιστοιχώντας σε πρωτογενές πλεόνασμα 3,2%. Αυτή η επιδείνωση στο πρωτογενές ισοζύγιο αντικατοπτρίζει κυρίως τις υψηλότερες δαπάνες τόκων και τον αντίκτυπο του νέου δημοσιονομικού πακέτου.
Ο δείκτης δημόσιου χρέους προς ΑΕΠ διαμορφώθηκε στο 154,2% το 2024, δηλαδή 55 π.μ. κάτω από τα υψηλά του2020. Αναμένεται να μειωθεί περαιτέρω, φτάνοντας το 138% το 2027. Η μείωση θα οφείλεται στην ονομαστική ανάπτυξη του ΑΕΠ καθώς και στα πρωτογενή πλεονάσματα του προϋπολογισμού.

Κόντρα μεταξύ της αξιωματικής αντιπολίτευσης και του κυβερνητικού εκπροσώπου, Παύλου Μαρινάκη, ξέσπασε με αφορμή τις δηλώσεις της βουλευτή του ΠΑΣΟΚ, Ράνιας Θρασκιά.
«Τσιπρολογία και Άγιος ο Θεός» αναφέρει, σε ανακοίνωσή του το ΠΑΣΟΚ, σχετικά με το σχόλιο του Κυβερνητικού εκπροσώπου Παύλου Μαρινάκη για την δήλωση της Ράνιας Θρασκιά.
Υπενθυμίζεται ότι, η βουλευτής Ράνια Θρασκιά είχε δηλώσει ότι το ΠΑΣΟΚ είναι ανοιχτό στο διάλογο ακόμα και με τον Τσίπρα, αλλά με αρχηγό τον Ανδρουλάκη. «Δεν νιώθουμε ότι μας απειλεί ο κ. Τσίπρας στο ΠΑΣΟΚ», σημείωσε ενώ πρόσθεσε: «Θεωρώ και ελπίζω πως ό,τι υπάρχει στη χώρα και εκφράζει τον προοδευτικό κόσμο να συσπειρωθεί με επικεφαλής το ΠΑΣΟΚ ακόμα και με τον κ. Τσίπρα» . « Αλήθεια, είναι όλοι στο ΠΑΣΟΚ σύμφωνοι με αυτές τις δηλώσεις» , αντέδρασε από την πλευρά του ο κ. Μαρινάκης.
«Ο κ. Μαρινάκης επέλεξε να μείνει σιωπηλός την επομένη της συζήτησης στη Βουλή για την ακρίβεια, όπου ο Πρωθυπουργός έδειξε την τεράστια απόσταση του από τις κοινωνικές ανάγκες φέρνοντας ως δικαιολογία για το ράλι ακρίβειας, την καρτελοποίηση της αγοράς, το δυσθεώρητο κόστος διαβίωσης και την καταρράκωση της αγοραστικής δύναμης των πολιτών το αμίμητο επιχείρημα «δεν είμαι ο Χάρι Πότερ».
Με την έναρξη της εβδομάδας ο Κυβερνητικός Εκπρόσωπος έδειξε την ατζέντα της κυβέρνησης: Τσιπρολογία και άγιος ο Θεός! Γιατί στο σκεπτικό του Μαξίμου «με μια Ιθάκη… ξεχνιέσαι». Που να συζητάμε τώρα για τα καθημερινά προβλήματα, τα σκάνδαλα, το μνημόνιο στον πρωτογενή τομέα κ.ο.κ.
Αυταπατάται όμως η κυβέρνηση της Νέας Δημοκρατίας, αν νομίζει ότι θα αλλάξει τη δημόσια ατζέντα. Οι πολίτες έπαθαν και έμαθαν και από τον κ. Τσίπρα και από τον κ. Μητσοτάκη. Μια από τα ίδια ισοδυναμεί με καθήλωση της χώρας και της ζωής τους».

Η δήλωση του γγ της ΚΕ του ΚΚΕ για την 52η επέτειο του Πολυτεχνείου.
«Η ιστορική πείρα διδάσκει ότι ο τροχός της ιστορίας προχωράει μπροστά μόνο όταν βγει στο προσκήνιο ο οργανωμένος και αποφασισμένος λαός» τόνισε ο γγ της ΚΕ του ΚΚΕ, Δημήτρης Κουτσούμας , ο οποίος ήταν μεταξύ χιλιάδων πολιτών στην πορεία τιμής και μνήμης για την 52η επέτειο του Πολυτεχνείου.
«Τα μηνύματα του Πολυτεχνείου είναι επίκαιρα. Τα μηνύματα για “Ψωμί, Παιδεία, Ελευθερία”, “έξω οι ΗΠΑ – έξω το ΝΑΤΟ”, για αποδέσμευση από τις ιμπεριαλιστικές συμμαχίες, τους πολέμους και τις επεμβάσεις τους ισχύουν μέχρι να έρθουν πραγματικά οι μέρες του φωτός» κατέληξε.

Για την έκδοση του ψηφιακού ευρώ εργάζεται η Ευρωπαϊκή Κεντρική Τράπεζα. “Θα μπορούσε να είναι έτοιμο για πρώτη έκδοση το 2029”.
Η ΕΚΤ εργάζεται συστηματικά προκειμένου να διασφαλίσει από τεχνικής πλευράς την έκδοση του ψηφιακού ευρώ διαβεβαίωσε σήμερα, Δευτέρα (17/11), το μέλος του Εκτελεστικού Συμβουλίου της Ευρωπαϊκής Κεντρικής Τράπεζας, Piero Cipollone, μιλώντας στο Ευρωπαϊκό Κοινοβούλιο.
Όπως είπε, τελική απόφαση του Διοικητικού Συμβουλίου της ΕΚΤ σχετικά με την έκδοση ψηφιακού ευρώ θα ληφθεί μόνο μετά την έγκριση της νομοθεσίας. Υποθέτοντας ότι οι Ευρωπαίοι νομοθέτες θα εγκρίνουν τον κανονισμό για τη θέσπιση του ψηφιακού ευρώ κατά τη διάρκεια του επόμενου έτους, θα μπορούσε να πραγματοποιηθεί πιλοτική εφαρμογή και να διενεργηθούν οι πρώτες συναλλαγές από τα μέσα του 2027, ενώ το ψηφιακό ευρώ θα μπορούσε να είναι έτοιμο για πρώτη έκδοση το 2029.
Ο P.Cipollone δήλωσε ότι οι καταναλωτές, οι έμποροι και οι τράπεζες «θα επωφεληθούν όλοι», ενώ η μείωση της εξάρτησης από μη ευρωπαϊκούς παρόχους θα ενισχύσει επίσης την ανθεκτικότητα, την αυτονομία και την οικονομική ασφάλεια της ηπείρου.
Ο ίδιος δεν συμμερίστηκε τις ανησυχίες που έχουν εκφραστεί από την πλευρά των τραπεζών για τη επαγόμενη αύξηση του κόστους συναλλαγών από την έλευση του ψηφιακού ευρώ, αναφέροντας ότι επί του παρόντος οι ευρωπαϊκές τράπεζες ήδη χάνουν προμήθειες από τα διεθνή συστήματα καρτών, και πληρωμών. Με το ψηφιακό ευρώ, όπως τόνισε, «το μοντέλο αποζημίωσης θα διασφαλίσει ότι οι τράπεζες θα επωφελούνται”.
«Το ψηφιακό ευρώ θα παρέχει μια ψηφιακή μορφή μετρητών που θα συμπληρώνει τα τραπεζογραμμάτια και τα κέρματα με τα οποία είμαστε εξοικειωμένοι, εξασφαλίζοντας έτσι ότι οι πληρωμές -τόσο οι φυσικές όσο και οι ψηφιακές- θα συνεχίσουν να λειτουργούν ανά πάσα στιγμή, χωρίς να εξαρτώνται από αποφάσεις που λαμβάνονται εκτός Ευρώπης. Το ψηφιακό ευρώ θα είναι μια ευρωπαϊκή λύση ψηφιακών πληρωμών που θα βασίζεται σε ευρωπαϊκή υποδομή – όλοι οι πάροχοι που έχουμε επιλέξει είναι υπήκοοι της ΕΕ και ελέγχονται από υπηκόους της ΕΕ. Παράλληλα θα προστατεύσει τη νομισματική μας κυριαρχία ακόμη και με την επέκταση των σταθερών νομισμάτων -τα οποία επί του παρόντος είναι κυρίως εκφρασμένα σε ξένα νομίσματα- και των κρυπτονομισμάτων χωρίς αντίκρισμα» ανέφερε o k. Cipollone.
«Οι λειτουργίες του ψηφιακού ευρώ online και offline θα αλληλοσυμπληρώνονται, συνδυάζοντας την ευκολία των ψηφιακών πληρωμών με την ανθεκτικότητα και την προσβασιμότητα των μετρητών, επιτρέποντας τη χρήση του ψηφιακού ευρώ σε οποιαδήποτε κατάσταση, από πλατφόρμες ηλεκτρονικού εμπορίου έως απομακρυσμένες περιοχές χωρίς κάλυψη δικτύου» , πρόσθεσε.

--- Summary ---
Ο Ντρέιμοντ Γκριν είχε ακόμη μία έντονη στιγμή με φίλαθλο, με τον σταρ των Γουόριορς να εξηγεί τι συνέβη και τον Στιβ Κερ να σχολιάζει πως το περιστατικό δεν κλιμακώθηκε, αλλά θα ήταν προτιμότερο να είχε παρέμβει νωρίτερα η ασφάλεια.

--- Full Text ---
Ο Ντρέιμοντ Γκριν βρέθηκε ξανά στο επίκεντρο μετά από λεκτική αντιπαράθεση με φίλαθλο, ο οποίος φέρεται να τον αποκαλούσε “Έιντζελ Ρις” (αθλήτρια του WNBA) σύμφωνα με το ρεπορτάζ του Άντονι Σλέιτερ του ESPN.
Ο φόργουορντ των Γουόριορς πλησίασε τον θεατή, όμως όπως ανέφερε αργότερα, “ όταν τον πλησίασα, δεν είπε περισσότερα. Δεν πειράζει, π ροχωράμε”.
Ο Στιβ Κερ , σχολίασε το επεισόδιο μετά το τέλος του αγώνα, τονίζοντας πως δεν γνωρίζει ακριβώς τι ειπώθηκε ώστε να τοποθετηθεί με ακρίβεια.
“ Όσο δεν υπάρχει κλιμάκωση, είναι εντάξει ένας παίκτης να πάει να μιλήσει. Θα ήταν καλύτερο, βέβαια, αν η ασφάλεια είχε φτάσει νωρίτερ α”.
Ο Γκριν έχει βρεθεί συχνά στο επίκεντρο τέτοιων περιστατικών, καθώς είναι γνωστός για την έντονη προσωπικότητά του.
Το 2022 είχε δεχθεί πρόστιμο 25.000 δολαρίων από το NBA για “ άσεμνη γλώσσα π ρος φίλ α θλο” όπως και στο παρελθόν έχει επικρίνει συμπεριφορές θεατών, υποστηρίζοντας ότι οι συνέπειες για όσους εκφράζονται απρεπώς είναι ελάχιστες, ενώ οι παίκτες τιμωρούνται όταν αντιδρούν.

Ο Τσάβι Πασκουάλ παρουσιάστηκε από τη διοίκηση της Μπαρτσελόνα τη Δευτέρα (17/11), με τον 53άχρονο τεχνικό να μιλάει για τους στόχους του στην ισπανική ομάδα.

--- Full Text ---
Ο Τσάβι Πασκουάλ επέστεψε στην τεχνική ηγεσία της Μπαρτσελόνα , έπειτα από εννέα χρόνια, με τους μπλαουγκράνα να ανακοινώνουν την επιστροφή του την Πέμπτη (13/11).
Μάλιστα, ο 53άχρονος προπονητής παρουσιάστηκε τη Δευτέρα (17/11) από τη διοίκηση της Μπαρτσελόνα, με τον ίδιο να μιλάει για τους νέους στόχους της ομάδας σε μία απαιτητική σεζόν της EuroLeague .
Αναλυτικά, οι δηλώσεις του Τσάβι Πασκουάλ:
“Ήταν μια όμορφη μέρα, έχω ανακτήσει την αίσθηση του ταξιδιού από την έδρα μας στο Παλάου Μπλαουγκράνα. Η σεζόν έχει ξεκινήσει και, σιγά σιγά, πρέπει να οδηγήσουμε την ομάδα προς το μονοπάτι που θέλουμε, το οποίο είναι να κάνουμε τους οπαδούς της Μπάρτσα χαρούμενους και η ομάδα να αντικατοπτρίζει τις αξίες της οντότητας της. Και, αν είναι δυνατόν, να είναι κοντά στο να διεκδικήσει όλους τους τίτλους.
Οι άνθρωποι στο Παλάου είναι εξαιρετικοί αλλά απαιτητικοί. Είτε κερδίζουμε είτε χάνουμε, πρέπει να τους δίνουμε πράγματα. Το DNA που έχουμε τόσα χρόνια πρέπει πάντα να είναι μπροστά από όλα και πρέπει να δημιουργήσουμε αυτή τη σφραγίδα, ώστε ο οπαδός να ενθουσιάζεται και να ταυτίζεται με την ομάδα.
Είμαι ένας προπονητής με περισσότερη εμπειρία. Το βάρος του να ζεις σε διαφορετικά μέρη σου φέρνει πολλά πράγματα και αυτό σε βοηθά να προσπαθείς να κάνεις τα πράγματα καλά, κάτι που πρέπει να κάνουμε τώρα”.

Title       : Ρεάλ: "Ο Πέρεθ σχεδιάζει να πουλήσει το 5% με 10% του συλλόγου σε εξωτερικό επενδυτή", αποκάλυψε ο Cadena Ser

--- Summary ---
Ο Φλορεντίνο Πέρεθ καμαρώνει για το ένδοξο παρελθόν και το λαμπρό παρόν της Ρεάλ αλλά ενδιαφέρεται και για το μέλλον του συλλόγου, με τον ισπανικό ραδιοφωνικό σταθμό Cadena Ser να αποκαλύπτει ότι έχει στο μυαλό του να παραχωρήσει σε έναν εξωτερικό επενδυτή το 5% με 10% των μετοχών του στους μερένγκες.

--- Full Text ---
Αναντίρρητα η Ρεάλ είναι ο πλέον επιτυχημένος ποδοσφαιρικός σύλλογος στον πλανήτη έχοντας 15 κατακτήσεις Champions League και ένα από τα σημαντικά όπλα της είναι πως διαθέτει μεγάλη οικονομική ευρωστία, με τους ανθρώπους της να μην σταματούν πάντως να σκέφτονται τρόπους για να κάνουν ακόμα πιο ισχυρό το κλαμπ.
Ενδεχομένως ένας από αυτούς να αφορά και την είσοδο νέων δυνατών “παικτών” στα κοινά του συλλόγου, με τον ισπανικό ραδιοφωνικό σταθμό Cadena Ser να αποκαλύπτει την Δευτέρα (17/11) ότι ο Φλορεντίνο Πέρεθ σχεδιάζει να πουλήσει το 5% έως 10% της Ρεάλ σε έναν εξωτερικό επενδυτή (σ.σ. κάποιον που δεν ανήκει στην εταιρία).
“Θα παρουσιάσει το σχέδιο στην έκτακτη κοινωνική συνάντηση αυτού του μήνα, στις 23 Νοεμβρίου. Ο πρόεδρος αποτιμά τον σύλλογο στα 10 δισεκατομμύρια ευρώ, πράγμα που σημαίνει ότι η πώληση θα αποφέρει μεταξύ 500 εκατομμυρίων ευρώ και 1 δισεκατομμυρίου ευρώ” , ανέφερε αρχικά στην El Pais ο Νταβίντ Άλβαρεθ, με τον ίδιο δημοσιογράφο να προσθέτει στην εκπομπή “Carrusel Canalla” του Cadena Ser.
“Υπάρχουν δύο πολύ σημαντικά πράγματα που θα ανακοινώσει ο Φλορεντίνο. Το ένα είναι ότι θέλει να ανοίξει τον σύλλογο σε έναν επενδυτή και το άλλο ότι ο σύλλογος δεν θα γίνει Ανώνυμη Αθλητική Εταιρεία (SAD). Θα αποκαλύψει επίσης ότι η υπόλοιπη ομάδα θα παραμείνει υπό τον έλεγχο των μελών και ο πρόεδρος θα συνεχίσει να εκλέγεται όπως πριν”.
Αυτή η πώληση, όπως εξηγεί ο Άλβαρεθ, μπορεί να γίνει με παρόμοιο τρόπο με τον οποίο η Ρεάλ συνεργάστηκε με δύο εταιρείες για τη διαχείριση της επιχείρησης του Μπερναμπέου: δημιουργώντας μια νέα εταιρεία και φέρνοντας άλλους επενδυτές.
“Υπάρχει μια εταιρεία που διαχειρίζεται την επιχείρηση του Μπερναμπέου εδώ και μήνες, στην οποία η Ρεάλ είναι εταίρος, και έχουν ενταχθεί και άλλοι εταίροι. Η ιδέα είναι προς αυτή την κατεύθυνση”, δήλωσε σχετικά.

Title       : Ολυμπιακός: Αυτές είναι οι λύσεις του Μεντιλίμπαρ για τη θέση του αριστερού μπακ, πίσω από τον Ορτέγκα, όταν ο Μπρούνο βρεθεί στο Κύπελλο Εθνών Αφρικής

Οι λύσεις του Χοσέ Λουίς Μεντιλίμπαρ για τη θέση του αριστερού μπακ, πίσω από τον Ορτέγκα, όταν ο Μπρούνο Ονιεμαέτσι βρεθεί στο Κύπελλο Εθνών Αφρικής.

--- Full Text ---
Ο Ολυμπιακός δεν θα εκπροσωπηθεί μόνο από τον Αγιούμπ Ελ Κααμπί στην τελική φάση του Κυπέλλου Εθνών Αφρικής , αλλά και από τον Μπρούνο Ονιεμαέτσι.
Η απουσία του Μαροκινού σέντερ φορ για περισσότερο από έναν μήνα στην πατρίδα του απασχολεί έντονα τους ερυθρόλευκους, αλλά δεν πάει πίσω κι εκείνη του Νιγηριανού αριστερού μπακ.
Θα πει κάποιος, ότι άλλο ο Ελ Κααμπί που είναι πρώτος σκόρερ και κομβικός παίκτης της πειραϊκής ομάδας κι άλλο ο Μπρούνο που είναι ουσιαστικά δεύτερη επιλογή πίσω από τον Φρανσίσκο Ορτέγκα. Όμως, η κατάσταση δεν είναι τόσο απλή.
Σε ό,τι αφορά την κορυφή της επίθεσης, ο Χοσέ Λουίς Μεντιλίμπαρ έχει τις εναλλακτικές λύσεις του Μέχντι Ταρέμι και του Ρόμαν Γιάρεμτσουκ.
Και σε έκτακτες περιπτώσεις έχουν χρησιμοποιηθεί ο Γιουσούφ Γιαζίτζι και ο Ζέλσον Μαρτίνς.
Στην αριστερή πλευρά της άμυνας, ωστόσο, απόντος του Νιγηριανού, θα υπάρχει μόνο η επιλογή του Αργεντινού ποδοσφαιριστή.
Και δεν είναι το πιο εύκολο πράγμα για έναν παίκτη να παίζει συνεχώς για ένα μήνα, στον οποίο να θυμίσουμε ο Ολυμπιακός θα δώσει πέντε αγώνες, με αντιπάλους τους Άρη εκτός (14/12), Ηρακλή εντός (16/12, στο Κύπελλο Ελλάδας Betsson ), Κηφισιά εντός (20/12), Ατρόμητο εκτός (10/1) και Αστέρα AKTOR εκτός έδρας (17/1).
Μάλιστα, ο 26χρονος αμυντικός δεν αποκλείεται να χάσει κι άλλους αγώνες των ερυθρόλευκων, αν η Ποδοσφαιρική Ομοσπονδία της Νιγηρίας επιμείνει να ενσωματωθεί νωρίτερα στην αποστολή της εθνικής ομάδας.
Σε αυτή την περίπτωση, ο Μπρούνο θα απουσιάσει επίσης από τα παιχνίδια με τον ΟΦΗ εντός (6/12) και την Καϊράτ Αλμάτι εκτός έδρας (9/12).
Ωστόσο, καταβάλλονται προσπάθειες, όχι μόνο από τον Ολυμπιακό, αλλά από πολλούς ευρωπαϊκούς συλλόγους, οι διεθνείς Αφρικανοί ποδοσφαιριστές να ενσωματωθούν στις εθνικές ομάδες μετά τις 11 Δεκεμβρίου, λόγω των διοργανώσεων του Champions League , του Europa League και του Conference League.
Ποιος θα είναι ο παρτενέρ του Ορτέγκα στη θέση του αριστερού μπακ τον ένα μήνα που θα απουσιάσει ο Μπρούνο;
Η μία λύση είναι να χρησιμοποιηθεί ο Κοστίνια, με τον Ροντινέι στη δεξιά πλευρά της άμυνας. Η δεύτερη λύση είναι να παίξει ο αριστεροπόδαρος Μάνσα.
Η τρίτη είναι να αγωνιστεί ο Βέζο, όπως στο ματς Κυπέλλου Ελλάδας Betsson με τον Βόλο στο Καραϊσκάκης, κι ο Πορτογάλος στόπερ να παραχωρηθεί το δεύτερο δεκαπενθήμερο του Ιανουαρίου, όταν θα έχει επιστρέψει ο Μπρούνο.
Η τέταρτη λύση είναι να προωθεί στην πρώτη ομάδα, είτε ο Αλαφάκης είτε ο Μαρτίνης. Κι η πέμπτη είναι να διακοπεί ο δανεισμός του Αθανασίου.
Ωστόσο, το τελευταίο έχει διάφορες παραμέτρους, καθώς ο Έλληνας άσος είναι βασικός στη Ρίο Άβε (έχει 12 συμμετοχές και μία ασίστ).
Παρεμπιπτόντως, ο Ονιεμαέτσι δεν αγωνίστηκε στη νίκη της Νιγηρίας 4-1 εις βάρος της Γκαμπόν, καθώς χρησιμοποιήθηκε ο Ζαϊντού της Πόρτο.
Ο αμυντικός του Ολυμπιακού όμως, ενδέχεται να παίξει την Κυριακή (16/11) στο ματς της Νιγηρίας με αντίπαλο την Δημοκρατία του Κονγκό.

Η Εθνική Ελλάδας αντιμετωπίζει τη Λευκορωσία την Τρίτη (18/11, 21:45, ALPHA , LIVE MATCHCENTER SPORT24 ) στο Ζάλαεγκερζεγκ της Ουγγαρίας για την 6η αγωνιστική των προκριματικών του Παγκοσμίου Κυπέλλου .

Για το τι έλειψε στα προκριματικά από την Ελλάδα : “ Θα έλεγα η συγκέντρωση στα κρισιμότατα παιχνίδια. Η αλήθεια είναι ότι επειδή το τουρνουά έγινε γρήγορα, με παιχνίδια σε τρεις μέρες. Αν εξαιρέσω το ματς με τη Δανία που έπρεπε να είμαστε καλύτερα προετοιμασμένοι, αναφορικά με τη σημασία του παιχνιδιού. Δεν έχει σχέση με το Nations League. Πιστεύω ότι και μετά από έναν χρόνο πολύ καλής παρουσίας, τα κρίσιμα παιχνίδια σε σύντομο διάστημα έπρεπε να είμαστε πιο συγκεντρωμένοι. Κάναμε περισσότερα λάθη από ότι σε όλα τα υπόλοιπα παιχνίδια. Αυτός είναι ο κύριος λόγος. Υπάρχουν παιχνίδια που πρέπει να κερδίσεις. Σε αυτό το κομμάτι υποφέραμε αρκετά. Δεν ήταν ο τρόπος παιχνιδιού. η διάθεση και η προσπάθεια. Ήταν λάθη που συσσωρεύτηκαν σε 2-3 παιχνίδια.
Είναι διαφορετικό το επίπεδο στα ματς του Σεπτεμβρίου. Όμως και αυτά τα παιχνίδια ήταν μια εμπειρία που τη ζούσαμε και λογικό είναι να μπορέσουμε να διορθώσουμε κάποια πράγματα στην προετοιμασία μας για τα παιχνίδια που έχουν υψηλό βαθμό ετοιμότητας. Αυτό πρωτίστως αφορά το θέμα της συγκέντρωσης και σημείων του παιχνιδιού που και ο αντίπαλος είναι ομάδα που ελέγχει το παιχνίδι. Δεν πρέπει να παρασυρθούμε αλλά να είμαστε έτοιμοι για αυτό”.
Για τον κίνδυνο αδιαφορίας : “Δεν έχει συμβεί και δεν πρόκειται να μην έχουμε σαν ομάδα αδιαφορία. Δεν είχαμε ποτέ κάτι τέτοιο. Δεν έχω αυτή την αίσθηση ότι μπορεί να συμβεί. Δεν έχω τέτοια σημάδια. Το αυριανό ματς δεν είναι ότι είναι το τελευταίο, είναι σε συνθήκες που δεν είχαμε μέχρι τώρα. Σε άδειο γήπεδο. Αλλά είναι προφανώς διαφορετικές οι συνθήκες. Ξέρετε και εσείς ότι σε ένα άδειο γήπεδο δεν είναι εύκολο. Είναι οι χειρότερες συνθήκες. Όσον αφορά τη νοοτροπία και τη διάθεση δεν νομίζω. Με προβληματίζουν περισσότερο οι συνθήκες του παιχνιδιού”.
Για το εκτός έδρας παιχνίδι με τη Σκωτία : “Με τη Σκωτία έξω κάναμε από τα πιο καλά παιχνίδια. όσον αφορά τον τρόπο προσέγγισης του παιχνιδιού, βάσει και των συνθηκών, ότι θέλαμε αποτυέλεσμα. Κάναμε εξαιρετικό παιχνίδι, δημιουργήσαμε πολλά. Ήταν ένα γεμάτο ματς. Εκείνο με τη Δανία ήταν δύσκολο να το εξηγήσουμε γιατί εκεί φάνηκε όπως εξελίχθηκε μεγάλη διαφορά στις δύο ομάδες ενώ ουσιαστικά δεν ήταν έτσι. Με πληγώνει το παιχνίδι στην έδρα μας με τη Δανία”.
Για όσα έχει κερδίσει η ομάδα και όσα την έχουν απογοητεύσει : “Σιγουρα κερδίσαμε αρκετά πράγματα. Πήραμε άνοδο μαζί με την Αγγλία και προκριθήκαμε στο πιο ψηλό επίπεδο. Αν αναλογιστούμε ότι από το 2018 η Ελλάδα ήταν στο τρίτο γκρουπ και πλέον είναι στο πρώτο, αλλάζει άρδην το επίπεδο που ουσιαστικά δείχνει και θα δείξει πού πραγματικά βρισκόμαστε σε σχέση με τις κορυφαίες ομάδες. Αυτό έγινε μέσα από τα καλά παιχνίδια που κάναμε και πολύ μεγάλη απογοήτευση μας μένει γιατί πίστευα ότι μέσα από αυτά τα παιχνίδια θα είμασταν στο ίδιο επίπεδο και στα προκριματικά και θα εξασφαλίζαμε με οποιοδήποτε τρόπο την παρουσία μας στο Μουντιάλ. Το ποδόσφαιρο ήταν αρκετά σκληρό μαζί μας. Είναι κάτι που θα πρέπει να ζήσουμε μαζί, και θα πρέπει να κάνουμε τα πάντα για να μη βρεθούμε στην ίδια θέση. Η ομάδα έχει δείξει ότι έχει να δώσει πολλά στο γήπεδο. Έχουμε δημιουργήσει ένα αγωνιστικό προφίλ. Όμως υπάρχουν και θέματα που πρέπει να διορθώσουμε για να έχουμε μεγαλύτερη σταθερότητα. Συγκέντρωση, πράγματα που μας δημιουργούν προβλήματα, αλλά είναι πράγματα που πρέπει να μάθουμε από τα παιχνίδια και όχι από την καθημερινή τριβή. Αλλαγές που μπορεί και πρέπει να κάνουμε για να είμαστε έτοιμοι”.
Για τη League A του Nations League : “Γενικώς είναι μια περίοδος δύσκολη. Πέρσι αυτή την περίοδο είχαμε μπροστά μας τα playoffs με τη Σκωτία. Και είχαμε θα έλεγα μια προετοιμασία για να διεκδικήσουμε έναν καλό στόχο. Τώρα δεν έχουμε κάτι τέτοιο. Θα προσπαθήσουμε μέσα από τα παιχνίδια του Μαρτίου να κάνουμε καλή προετοιμασία για τα παιχνίδια τον Σεπτέμβριο. Επειδή το πρώτο γκρουπ δεν μας δίνει περιθώρια χαλάρωσης, είναι ματς υψηλού επιπέδου, θα προσπαθήσουμε να είμαστε έτοιμοι για τον Σεπτέμβριο και τον Νοέμβριο. Θα μπορεί να μας δώσει πράγματα για τις κληρώσεις για το Euro. Θα είναι παιχνίδια με ιδιαίτερο ενδιαφέρον και με ομάδες που είναι σε έναν βαθμό ετοιμότητας και επίπεδο πιο υψηλό από εμάς. Αν δούμε τα γκρουπ είναι έτσι. Να έχουμε ανάλογες εμπειρίες με αυτό που θα αντιμετωπίσουμε στη συνέχεια. Έχουμε και νέα παιδιά που δεν έχουν τόσες εμπειρίες σε αυτό το επίπεδο. Τα παιχνίδια για αυτούς είναι μια νέα εμπειρία γιατί και το επίπεδο των Εθνικών Ομάδων θα είναι το πιο υψηλό. Οι εμπειρίες των παικτών παίζουν σημαντικό ρόλο”.
Για τη συγκέντρωση : “Υπήρχαν πράγματα όπου μετά από μεγάλο χρονικό διάστημα δεχθήκαμε γκολ με τρόπους που δεν είχαμε συνηθίσει. Λένε ότι είναι θέμα συγκέντρωσης, όμως κάναμε και λάθη. Έτυχαν στα παιχνίδια που ήταν πολύ κρίσιμα. Και προχθές έγιναν λάθη. Μπορεί να είναι κούραση ή συγκέντρωση. Υπάρχουν πάντα θέματα με τις Εθνικές Ομάδες, είναι διαφορετικές οι προσεγγίσεις. Για αυτό βλέπετε κάποιες εκπλήξεις στα διεθνή παιχνίδια. Αλλά εδώ σε εμάς χρειάζεται μεγάλη συγκέντρωση αφού δεν έχουμε καθημερινή τριβή. Πάντα ζητάμε αυτή η συγκέντρωση να είναι στον μέγιστο βαθμό. Μπορεί εμείς να τους ζητάμε διαφορετικά πράγματα από τις ομάδες τους. Ξέρετε στη διάρκεια του αγώνα όταν έρχονται δυσκολίες, είναι σημαντικές οι συνήθειες του παιχνιδιού”.
Για το αν υπάρχει άγχος : “Παίζει και ο αντίπαλος, μην το ξεχνάτε. Το άγχος για να οδηγήσουμε την ομάδα σε μια μεγάλη διοργάνωση δεν είναι κάτι νέο, είναι θετικό. Όταν έχεις ένταση σίγουρα υπάρχει και λίγο στρες. Είναι θετικό γιατί θέλεις να πάρεις το καλύτερο δυνατό αποτέλεσμα. Υπάρχουν κάποιες φάσες που έγιναν που δεν είναι στο ποδόσφαιρο πάντα εύκολο να τα εξηγήσουμε όλα. Και σαν προπονητής δεν μπορείς να εξηγήσεις γιατί γίνονται κάποια πράγματα. Για εσάς είναι πιο εύκολο γιατί απέξω σχολιάζετε αυτό που βλέπετε. Το ποδόσφαιρο είναι απρόβλεπτο. Το κάθε τι μπορέι να αλλάξει την ψυχολογία του παιχνιδιού. Είναι πολλά που εξαρτώνται καθαρά από τη στιγμή της συγκέντρωσης και της αντίδρασης στις δυσκολίες. Τη δυσκολία να μπορείς να έισαι πάντα προεοτιμασμένος για οτιδήποτε συμβεί. Έχουν πλεονέκτημα οι ομάδες που έχουν εμπειρία από πολύ απαιτητικά παιχνίδια. Πάντα πιστεύω ότι οι καλύτεροι αντίπαλοι θα σε κάνουν καλύτερο για το αύριο. Το θεωρώ απόλυτα φυσιολογικό. Εμένα με κάνουν καλύτερο, τους παίκτες επίσης από την απόψη της δυσκολίας και του βαθμού ετοιμότητας που απαιτείται. Έχουμε ξεπεράσει το δεύτερο γκρουπ δυναμικότητας με μεγάλη δυναμική και μπήκαμε δίκαια και σύντομα στο πρώτο γκρουπ δυναμικότητας. Όμως τα πράγματα τώρα θα είναι τελείως διαφορετικά. Εκεί είναι πολύ πιο σοβαρά τα πράγματα”.
Για το Σκωτία – Δανία και αν θα κάνει αλλαγές : “Δεν θέλω πολύ συζήτηση για το Δανία – Σκωτία. Δεν με απασχολεί, δεν είμαστε εκεί. Βάσει των παιχνιδιών που έχουμε κάνει θα έπρεπε να είμαστε εκεί. Θα γίνουν αλλαγές για λόγους που αφορούν και το ματς με τη Σκωτία, που ήταν πολύ απαιτητικό όπως εξελίχθηκε. Βρεθήκαμε από το 3-0 να υποφέρουμε. Ήταν δύσκολο παιχνίδι. Άρα βάση και των εικόνων που έχω από τους παίκτες και το ίδιο το παιχνίδι, φάνηκε ότι ήταν ένα από τα πιο απαιτητικά παιχνίδια. Αλλά πρέπει να υπάρχουν κάποιες αλλαγές, να φρεσκάρουμε κάποια πράγματα. Το να κάνω μεγάλο ροτέισιον είναι πολύ χρήσιμο. Πρέπει να έχουμε μια ομάδα που θα έχει κάποιες αλλαγές, έχουμε και μια ομάδα που είναι τελείως διαφορετική σε σχέση με τα προηγούμενα ματς και είναι και οι μη ιδανικές συνθήκρες παιχνιδιού”.

Η Εθνική Ελλάδας αντιμετωπίζει τη Λευκορωσία την Τρίτη (18/11, 21:45, ALPHA , LIVE MATCHCENTER SPORT24 ) στο Ζάλαεγκερζεγκ της Ουγγαρίας για την 6η αγωνιστική των προκριματικών του Παγκοσμίου Κυπέλλου .
Στη συνέντευξη Τύπου ενόψει του αγώνα τη Δευτέρα (17/11) το απόγευμα και ενώ είχε τον λόγο ο Πάνος Ρέτσος , ο Ιβάν Γιοβάνοβιτς τον διέκοψε ευγενικά, πλέκοντας το εγκώμιο του 27χρονου αρχηγού του Ολυμπιακού.
“Ο Ρέτσος είναι το καλύτερο παράδειγμα της αφοσίωσης όσον αφορά την Εθνική Ομάδα” , ανέφερε χαρακτηριστικά ο έμπειρος τεχνικός.
“Είναι ένας παίκτης ο οποίος παίζει βασικός σε μια μεγάλη ομάδα, με ευρωπαϊκά παιχνίδια και διακρίσεις. Δεν είχε παίξει σε πολλά παιχνίδια κρίσιμα ο ίδιος, η συμπεριφορά του αντανακλά και το κλίμα στην Εθνική Ομάδα.
Και τη στιγμή που χρειάστηκε να παίξει, είδατε και εσείς, ότι ήταν απόλυτα απόλυτα έτοιμος για να κάνει στο μέγιστο αυτό που έπρεπε” , πρόσθεσε ο Γιοβάνοβιτς για τον Ρέτσο.

Μετά από δέκα χρόνια συμπόρευσης οι δρόμοι της ΑΕΚ και του Χάρη Λάλου χώρισαν, με τον επικεφαλής ιατρό της Ένωσης να υποβάλλει την παραίτησή του από τον σύλλογο και να στέλνει αποχαιρετιστήριο μήνυμα μέσω του λογαριασμού του στο Facebook.

--- Full Text ---
Παρελθόν από την ΑΕΚ αποτελεί επίσημα από την Δευτέρα (17/11) ο Χάρης Λάλος, με τον γιατρό της ομάδας να παραιτείται από τη θέση που είχε εδώ και δέκα χρόνια στους κιτρινόμαυρους και να κοινοποιεί την απόφασή του αυτή μέσω του λογαριασμού που διατηρεί στο Facebook.
Γενικότερα, υπήρχε μία δυσαρέσκεια για τους τραυματισμούς και τις αναλύσεις αυτών, και φαινόταν ότι κάποια στιγμή η ομάδα θα προχωρήσει σε αλλαγή του ιατρικού επιτελείου. Ο κ. Λάλος απ’ την πλευρά του το είχε αντιληφθεί και προτίμησε να αποχωρήσει από τη θέση του.
“Σήμερα ολοκληρώνεται για μένα ένας κύκλος σχεδόν δέκα ετών, γεμάτος εμπειρίες, προκλήσεις και αξέχαστες στιγμές. Με πλήρη επίγνωση και προσωπική επιλογή, αποφάσισα ότι έφτασε η κατάλληλη στιγμή να αποχωρήσω από τη θέση του ιατρού της ΑΕΚ και να ανοίξω ένα νέο κεφάλαιο με νέες επαγγελματικές προκλήσεις.
Θα ήθελα να εκφράσω τη βαθιά μου ευγνωμοσύνη προς τον πρόεδρο για την εμπιστοσύνη που μου έδειξε ,καθώς και προς όλο το προσωπικό για την άψογη και ουσιαστική συνεργασία μας. Η καθημερινή μας κοινή πορεία υπήρξε δημιουργική.
Εύχομαι σε όλους υγεία και δύναμη για το μέλλον”, ήταν το αποχαιρετιστήριο μήνυμά του μέσω του λογαριασμού του στο Facebook.

Μια νέα παγκόσμια έρευνα της Ampere Analysis έρχεται να ανατρέψει την εικόνα που συχνά παρουσιάζεται για τις προτιμήσεις των gamers. Παρότι τα μεγάλα στούντιο επενδύουν ολοένα και περισσότερο σε multiplayer, live-service και online εμπειρίες, η πλειονότητα των παικτών εξακολουθεί να προτιμά τα single-player παιχνίδια.
Η Ampere ανέλυσε τις απαντήσεις περισσότερων από 34.000 παικτών και διαπίστωσε ότι σε βασικές αγορές όπως οι ΗΠΑ, η Ιαπωνία και το Ηνωμένο Βασίλειο, το single-player παραμένει ξεκάθαρα η δημοφιλέστερη επιλογή. Το εύρημα αυτό δείχνει ότι ο κόσμος συνεχίζει να αναζητά ιστορίες, προσωπικό ρυθμό και αυτονομία στο gameplay, παρά την επικράτηση των online τάσεων.
Η έρευνα εντόπισε επίσης μια σαφή διαφορά ανά ηλικιακή ομάδα. Οι παίκτες 16–24 ετών είναι οι μόνοι που εμφανίζουν μικρότερη προτίμηση στο single-player, κάτι που συνδέεται με την επιτυχία τίτλων που βασίζονται στην κοινωνική διάδραση. Από τα 25 και πάνω, όμως, το ενδιαφέρον για solo εμπειρίες αυξάνεται σταθερά, φτάνοντας στο υψηλότερο ποσοστό στους παίκτες 55–64 ετών.
Παράλληλα, το 24% των συμμετεχόντων δήλωσε ότι επηρεάζεται άμεσα από το τι παίζουν οι φίλοι του, ένα στοιχείο που δείχνει πως η κοινωνική αλληλεπίδραση εξακολουθεί να διαμορφώνει τις αγορές, ακόμη κι όταν η προτίμηση είναι το single-player.
Η Louise Wooldridge, senior research manager της Ampere, σχολιάζει ότι τα δεδομένα επιβεβαιώνουν πως τα single-player παιχνίδια παραμένουν απολύτως βιώσιμα και περιζήτητα, παρά την κυριαρχία των multiplayer μοντέλων monetisation.

Προς τα τέλη του Οκτωβρίου είχε ακουστεί ότι η Microsoft θα πραγματοποιήσει ένα νέο Showcase event μέσα στον Νοέμβριο, για να παρουσιάσει παιχνίδια του Xbox και του PC, από τρίτες εταιρίες.
Τώρα, μια νέα φήμη έρχεται στη δημοσιότητα για να μας πει και πάλι ότι η εταιρία έχει στα σκαριά ένα ολοκαίνουργιο Xbox Partner Preview. Όπως μαθαίνουμε από το Insider Gaming, το νέο Xbox Partner Preview θα επικεντρώνεται σε παιχνίδια του Xbox που έρχονται με την σήμανση «Xbox Play Anywhere», δηλαδή παιχνίδια που θα μπορούν να παίξουν οι παίκτες τόσο στο Xbox, όσο και στο PC.
Τη νέα φήμη φέρνει ο γνωστός insider, NateTheHate2, καθώς μέσα από το X (πρώην Twitter) είπε ότι η επικείμενη ανακοίνωση για το νέο Xbox Partner Preview θα γίνει σύντομα. Ωστόσο, δεν αποκαλύφθηκε κάποια συγκεκριμένη ημερομηνία.
Σε άλλα νέα, αναμένουμε το Xbox να παρευρεθεί και στα φετινά The Game Awards που αναμένεται να πραγματοποιηθούν στις 11 Δεκεμβρίου. Για οτιδήποτε νεότερο προκύψει παραμείνετε συντονισμένοι στο Unboxholics.com.

Ένας γνωστός insider της Rockstar υποστηρίζει ότι το GTA 6 χρησιμοποιεί τόσο προχωρημένα τεχνικά συστήματα, που άλλες εταιρείες μπορεί να χρειαστούν 15–20 χρόνια για να τα φτάσουν.
Ο Reece “Kiwi Talkz” Reilly, με ιστορικό έγκυρων πληροφοριών, σχολίασε σε ανάρτησή του ως απάντηση σε fan που ρώτησε αν ο νέος τίτλος θυμίζει απλώς αναβαθμισμένο GTA V, ότι το GTA 6 δεν έχει καμία σχέση με “GTA V 2.0”, αλλά αποτελεί ένα από τα πιο φιλόδοξα project της Rockstar.
Οι δηλώσεις του ταιριάζουν με παλαιότερες πατέντες και διαρροές που μιλούν για NPCs που θυμούνται τι έχει κάνει ο παίκτης, πιο φυσικές αντιδράσεις ανάλογα με όσα βλέπουν ή ακούν, πληροφορίες για ανίχνευση μυρωδιών σε NPCs και έναν κόσμο που μεταβάλλεται από τις επιλογές του παίκτη, όχι μόνο από το σενάριο.
Αν και τίποτα από αυτά δεν έχει παρουσιαστεί επίσημα, εξηγεί γιατί η Rockstar έχει αλλάξει πολλές φορές το χρονοδιάγραμμα. Το GTA 6 μετακινήθηκε αρχικά από το Φθινόπωρο του 2025, στη συνέχεια στον Μάιο του 2026 και πλέον αναμένεται τον Νοέμβριο του 2026.
Μέχρι να δούμε gameplay, όλα παραμένουν σε επίπεδο πληροφοριών από πηγές, αλλά η εικόνα που διαμορφώνεται δείχνει έναν τίτλο που θέλει να καθορίσει το open-world gaming για πολύ καιρό.
