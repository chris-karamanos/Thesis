Fifty-year mortgages and $2,000 cheques: What's behind Trump's affordability drive?
Facing growing public pessimism about his handling of the economy, US President Donald Trump has fired off a flurry of proposals to address consumer concerns.
Trump previously downplayed concerns about cost of living, insisting the outlook had improved during his nine months in office. He said affordability was a "new word", and a "con job" by Democrats.
But he has focused on the issue with some urgency since his Republican Party's poor performance in last week's off-year elections across a handful of states.
He is again proposing an idea to give most Americans a $2,000 (£1,500) "subsidy".
In reality the payments would operate more like a rebate for federal revenue generated by his tariffs on foreign imports.
The rest of the tariff revenue, he has said, would go to reducing the federal budget deficit.
According to economists, however, the tariff revenue isn't nearly enough to cover the $2,000 rebate plan, even with the most generous assumptions and a narrow definition of those with incomes to qualify.
"If we take something like a cut-off of $100,000 a year in income, the minimum cost would be about $300bn, which would absorb all of the tariff revenue that's been taken in so far and would require some deficit financing," says Erica York, vice-president of tax policy at the non-partisan Tax Foundation.
What's more, according to Ms York, the tariff refunds might end up being counterproductive by driving up prices as more money is pushed into the American economy. Covid-era stimulus payments may have created a similar dynamic, albeit in a larger scale.
"It would give large sums of money to households who are more likely to consume that than save it," she said. "So we would have more dollars chasing goods in the economy."
On Sunday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent seemed to downplay the possibility of such payments, saying that the revenue gains from the tariffs would be reflected in lower tax rates paid by Americas next year under the provisions of Trump's 2025 "Big, Beautiful Bill" spending package, which Congress passed in July.
In last week's elections, when Democrats notched up a string of victories, exit polls indicated the economy once again led all issues as the subject of concern for American voters.
Zohran Mamdani made affordability the key to his successful campaign for New York City mayor, as did Abigail Spanberger in Virginia and Mikie Sherrill in New Jersey with their winning runs for governor.
The exit poll results match recent opinion surveys that have suggested the public is souring on Trump's handling of the economy and his inability, in their view, to follow through on campaign promises to lower costs for American consumers.
Another of Trump's ideas involves promoting 50-year mortgages – an alternative to the 30-year mortgages that are standard for American home purchases.
The president has touted the extended payment schedule as a way to make home ownership easier for Americans.
Many in his own party, however, view it as a boon for lenders who will collect bigger fees and more interest.
"I don't like 50-year mortgages as the solution to the housing affordability crisis," Republican congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia wrote on X.
"It will ultimately reward banks, mortgage lenders and home builders while people pay far more in interest over time and die before they ever pay off their home."
Trump appears to have floated this idea without consulting senior White House advisers – a reflection of his willingness to move quickly on new ideas, but with the risk of giving his advisers little time to offer input.
Trump has also suggested taking government health insurance subsidies that will expire at the end of the year – which Democrats have unsuccessfully fought to extend during the 43-day government shutdown – and turning them into direct cash payments to consumers.
During an interview with Fox News, the president said this would allow American consumers to be more like "entrepreneurs" and "go out and negotiate their own insurance".
All of these proposals would likely require congressional implementation, which is far from guaranteed with narrow Republican majorities in both chambers.
Trump has broached other, more modest proposals for reducing costs, such as ordering a federal investigation into beef prices and reaching an agreement with pharmaceutical manufacturers to lower the price of obesity drugs for uninsured buyers.
"It feels right now they're just throwing all sorts of ideas out there to test them to see if they sound good," says Ms York.
Trump's electoral success – his ability to challenge long-held conservative orthodoxy and overcome seemingly formidable public concerns - demonstrate his well-tuned political instincts.
When he has sensed vulnerability in the past, he's frequently used his political rallies and public appearances to sound out new ideas and gauge popular support.
But this is harder to do from the confines of the Oval Office, which is why the White House is discussing whether he should travel the country to give speeches on the economy, according to CNN.
Some of Trump's other actions risk undermining his attempts at recalibrating his policies to reflect a darkening public mood.
For instance, Trump continues to insist that prices are dropping. In some cases – such as eggs and dairy products – he's right.
But in others – those aforementioned beef, as well as coffee and electricity – costs are on the rise.
The president has repeatedly noted that the price of a Thanksgiving meal at Walmart is less than last year.
But he doesn't mention that the retail chain's dinner package this season contains half as many items and a smaller turkey.
All the while, his administration has fought in court to end food aid during the government shutdown, and the president has relentlessly touted the multi-billion-dollar renovations he's overseeing to the White House.
Four years ago, Joe Biden's White House was insisting that the economy was strong even as post-Covid consumer costs spiralled higher.
For the next three years of his administration, the Democratic president and his aides pointed to economic indicators and data in vain, as the public's mood remained dark.
At 3%, inflation under Trump is still way below the 9.1% rate it peaked at under Biden, which was the worst cost-of-living crunch for decades.
Trump effectively exploited this disconnect between the Democratic leadership in Washington and American voters' sentiment during his 2024 presidential campaign.
Now, however, Trump finds himself facing similar circumstances, as Republicans seek to avoid a similar fate in the elections to come.

Title       : US ends penny-making run after more than 230 years

US ends penny-making run after more than 230 years
The US is set to make its final penny.
The Philadelphia Mint will strike its last batch of one-cent coins on Thursday, after more than 230 years of production.
The coins will remain in circulation but the phase-out has already prompted businesses to start adjusting prices, as they say pennies are becoming harder to find.
The government says the move will save money, or as President Donald Trump put it in February when he first announced the plans: "Rip the waste out of our great nation's budget, even if it's a penny at a time".
Pennies, which honour Civil War president Abraham Lincoln and are made of copper-plated zinc, today cost nearly four cents each to make — more than twice the cost of a decade ago, according to the Treasury Department. It estimates the decision to end production will save about $56m a year.
Officials have argued that the rise of electronic transactions is making the penny, which first went into production in 1793, increasingly moot.
The Treasury Department estimates that about 300 billion of the coins will remain in circulation, "far exceeding the amount needed for commerce".
Many pennies end up falling out of use. About 60% of all coins in circulation in the US - or about $60-$90 for the typical household - sits stashed at home in piggy banks, deemed not worth trading in, according to a 2022 government analysis.
But penny-pinchers beware: as businesses start rounding up prices, the move is expected to raise costs for shoppers. One study by researchers at the Richmond Federal Reserve estimated that could cost consumers $6m annually.
Other countries have also phased out their lowest value coins. Canada, for example, made its last batch of one cent coins in 2012.
Australia and New Zealand retired one and two cent coins in the 1990s, and New Zealand stopped production of five cent coins in 2006.
The UK floated a plan to scrap 1p coins in 2018, though the proposal was later withdrawn.
But the rise of electronic transactions did prompt the UK to halt production of coins in 2024, after officials decided there were sufficient 1p and 2p coins in circulation.
In the US attention has now turned to the nickel, which has a face value of five cents but costs nearly 14 cents to produce.
Retiring that coin would have a far bigger impact on shoppers, costing consumers some $55m per year, according to the Richmond Fed study.

At least six die in crush at Ghana military recruitment event
At least six people have died during a crowd crush at a military recruitment event in a stadium in Ghana.
Wednesday's "tragic" crush appeared to have been caused by "an unexpected surge of applicants who breached security protocols and rushed into the gates," said a statement from Ghana's armed forces.
Twenty-two others were injured, including five who remain in critical condition.
Thousands had turned up to El-Wak stadium, in the capital, Accra, with the hope of joining the military.
Ghana has a youth unemployment rate of about 32%, the latest government statistics show, and such recruitment events normally draw large crowds and often result in chaotic scenes.
The deadline to apply for this event was extended by a week to accommodate more applicants, as some had experienced difficulties in the process.
Army spokesperson Capt Veronica Adzo Arhin said the crush occurred ahead of the event's scheduled start of 06:20 GMT.
On the same day, five people were injured in a crush at separate military recruitment session in the central city of Kumasi, regional official Dr Frank Amoakohene reported on Facebook.
In Accra, families crowded the emergency ward at the 37 Military Hospital, desperate for news of their loved ones, the AFP news agency reported.
Relatives wept while security officers struggled to contain the crowd outside.
Ghana's President John Mahama arrived in the afternoon to visit the injured.
Despite the deaths, the recruitment exercise did start, but it was suspended in the afternoon "to allow for additional measures to ensure a seamless exercise", Capt Arhin said.
She added that there would be an investigation into the crush.

Major corruption scandal engulfs top Zelensky allies
Ukraine's energy and justice ministers have resigned in the wake of a major investigation into corruption in the country's energy sector.
President Volodymyr Zelensky called for Energy Minister Svitlana Grynchuk and Justice Minister Herman Halushchenko's removal on Wednesday.
On Monday anti-corruption bodies accused several people of orchestrating a embezzlement scheme in the energy sector worth about $100m (£76m), including at the national nuclear operator Enerhoatom.
Some of those implicated in the scandal are - or have been - close associates of Zelensky's.
The allegation is that Justice Minister Herman Halushchenko and other key ministers and officials received payments from contractors building fortifications against Russian attacks on energy infrastructure.
Among those alleged to be involved are former Deputy Prime Minister Oleksiy Chernyshov and Timur Mindich - a businessman and a co-owner of Zelensky's former TV studio Kvartal95. He has since reportedly fled the country.
Halushchenko said he would defend himself against the accusations, while Grynchuk said on social media: "Within the scope of my professional activities there were no violations of the law."
The National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (Nabu) and Specialised Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office (Sap) said the investigation - which was 15 months in the making and involved 1,000 hours of audio recordings - uncovered the participation of several members of the Ukrainian government.
According to Nabu, the people involved systematically collected kickbacks from Enerhoatom contractors worth between 10% and 15% of contract values.
The anti-corruption bodies also said the huge sums had been laundered in the scheme and published photographs of bags full of cash. The funds were then transferred outside Ukraine, including to Russia, Nabu said.
Prosecutors alleged that the scheme's proceeds were laundered through an office in Kyiv linked to the family of former Ukrainian lawmaker and current Russian senator Andriy Derkach.
Nabu has been releasing new snippets of its investigation and wiretaps every day and on Tuesday it promised more would come.
The scandal is unfolding against the backdrop of escalating Russian attacks on Ukrainian energy facilities, including substations that supply electricity to nuclear power plants.
It will also shine a spotlight on corruption in Ukraine, which continues to be endemic despite work by Nabu and Sap in the 10 years since they were created.
In July, nationwide protests broke out over changes curbing the independence of Nabu and Sap. Ukrainians feared the nation could lose the coveted status of EU candidate country which it was granted on condition it mounted a credible fight against corruption.
Kyiv's European partners also expressed severe alarm at the decision, with ambassadors from the G7 group of nations expressing the desire to discuss the issue with the Ukrainian leadership.
The backlash was the most severe to hit the Ukrainian government since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022 and was only quelled by Zelensky's decision to reinstate the freedom of the two anti-corruption bodies.
Yet for some that crisis brought into question Zelensky's dedication to anti-corruption reforms. The latest scandal threatens to lead to more awkward questions for the Ukrainian president.

At least 37 killed in Peru after bus plunges into ravine
At least 37 people were killed and dozens injured in Peru when a bus plunged into a 200m (650ft) deep ravine after a head-on collision.
The incident happened in the early hours of Wednesday morning on a "rugged" stretch of the Pan-American Highway that connects Peru with Chile in the country's southern region of Arequipa.
Local media say the bus was carrying 60 passengers when it smashed into a pickup truck on a curve, careered off the road and fell down to the banks of the Ocoña River.
Bus crashes are common in Peru, especially at night and on mountain highways. This is often due to poor road conditions, excessive speed, and lack of safety signage.
The bus, operated by the Llamosas company, was heading from Chala, a town in Caraveli province, to Arequipa.
Both drivers reportedly survived the crash, which happened at kilometre 780 of the Pan-American Highway South.
Pictures from the scene of the crash show the wrecked bus at the bottom of a steep ravine - its windows completely shattered, bodywork badly damaged and roof caved in.
Waldor Llerena, Ocona's district mayor, told radio station RPP that the terrain around the crash site is "very rugged", and the area had a history of similar deadly accidents.
Thirty-six people died at the scene and another person later died in hospital, Walther Oporto, Arequipa's regional health chief told local media, citing firefighters at the scene of the crash.
Health officials told RPP that 25 people - including three minors - are being treated in a local hospital for their injuries.
An investigation into the incident is underway and the driver of the pickup truck has been detained, the Public Prosecutor's Office said in a statement.
In 2022, more than 3,300 people died in traffic accidents in Peru, official figures suggest.
Stretching from Alaska to the pencil tip of Argentina, the 48,000km-long Pan-American Highway holds the record for the world's longest road navigable by motor vehicle.

--- Full Text ---
Nico Harrison is "in good spirits" and planning to spend time with his wife and daughters after being fired 11 games into his fourth season as the Dallas Mavericks' general manager, NBA insider Chris Haynes said Tuesday.
"He's in good spirits, man. He's going to take some time to be with himself and his family and just get away from everything," Haynes said on NBA TV. "It's been a tough situation.
"I think when you look at his tenure with the Dallas Mavericks, you had some good times, definitely had some bad times. He guided the team to the NBA Finals, and they have visions of getting further than that but ultimately his tenure is going to be defined by the Luka Doncic trade and what he got in return and other people will say well, what he didn't get in return. So, it was a tough situation, but something we saw coming definitely over this past week or so."
The Mavericks announced Tuesday that Harrison, who contributed to constructing the team that made it to the 2024 NBA Finals before dismantling that roster by trading Luka Dončić last season, had been dismissed after a 3-8 start to the 2025-26 campaign.
Mavs owner Patrick Dumont said in an open letter to fans that "no one associated with the Mavericks organization is happy" with that season-opening record.
"You have high expectations for the Mavericks, and I share them with you," Dumont wrote. "When the results don't meet expectations, it's my responsibility to act."
Dallas has struggled over the early stretch of the season not just because Kyrie Irving is continuing to recover from a torn ACL but because Anthony Davis, the centerpiece of the return Harrison brought to Dallas in exchange for sending Dončić to the Los Angeles Lakers, has been sidelined for most of the last seven games with a calf injury.
Dumont will hope to see his team bounce back down the stretch, given the hope that Davis and Irving will be able to play alongside 2025 top pick Cooper Flagg for the first time later this season.
What Dumont can't change, however, is Dončić's departure from Dallas. A fan told The Athletic's Devon Henderson that Dumont apologized to a fan for the trade the night before Harrison's dismissal.

Ahead of Tuesday's 122-108 home loss to the Denver Nuggets, Sacramento Kings head coach Doug Christie stood up for his team while addressing the media.

--- Full Text ---
Ahead of Tuesday's 122-108 home loss to the Denver Nuggets, Sacramento Kings head coach Doug Christie stood up for his team while addressing the media.
Speaking to reporters before the Kings fell to 3-8 on the season, Christie vowed to eventually "get it right," and play winning basketball consistently.
"When I see the hate, the haters, the fakers—all you guys, you keep that energy," Christie said. "That's good. You keep that. And you know who you are because while you're doing that, we're gonna be working. And while you're doing that, we're gonna be growing. And while you do that, eventually, we're gonna be coming—the Kings Show. Sac proud, know that."
Christie, 55, spent five of his 15 seasons as an NBA guard with the Kings from 2000 to 2005 before transitioning into coaching.
He was a Kings assistant coach from 2021 to 2024 and then served as Sacramento's interim head coach last season following the firing of Mike Brown.
Christie led the team to a 27-24 record, and the interim tag was removed in May, officially making him the new head coach of the Kings.
The Kings are a veteran-laden team led by Domantas Sabonis, Zach LaVine, DeMar DeRozan, Dennis Schröder and Russell Westbrook, which suggests they entered the 2025-26 campaign with the goal of contending for a playoff spot.
However, early returns suggest they will be hard pressed to get one in the supremely deep and talented Western Conference.
If the Kings miss the playoffs, it will mark the 19th time they have done so in the past 20 seasons.
Christie's comments on Tuesday night came before another one-sided loss, but also after Carmichael Dave of 1140 KHTK in Sacramento expressed his belief that the Kings are heading toward a full-scale rebuild like the ones the Oklahoma City Thunder and San Antonio Spurs went through before becoming top teams:
If that is the case, there is no question the Kings have some desirable pieces to trade, as several of their veterans could help contending teams immensely.
However, if the decision is made to tear it down, it will likely be a long road back to relevancy for the Kings with the hope that the draft picks acquired in trades involving their veteran players will develop into quality NBA players.
That would also make it difficult for Christie to make good on his vows in the near future, although a rebuild is likely best for the Kings' long-term viability.

Memphis Grizzlies star Ja Morant was seemingly unimpressed with a fan's attempt to recruit him to the New York Knicks.
A video posted Tuesday night to TikTok showed a fan asking Morant to come to New York as he walked into the tunnel at Madison Square Garden.
"I'm cool," Morant responded.
Morant and the Grizzlies lost 133-120 on Tuesday night to Jalen Brunson and the Knicks, who improved to 7-0 at home so far this season.
The Grizzlies meanwhile fell to 4-8 overall and 1-3 on the road. Morant's shooting struggles continued as he went 4-for-14 from the field while contributing 16 points in the loss.
He was already coming off his worst shooting performance of the season last Sunday, when he went 3-for-18 against the Oklahoma City Thunder at home.
Morant's early-season struggles have reportedly led to a clash between him and first-year head coach Tuomas Iisalo.
The Grizzlies dealt Morant a one-game suspension for "conduct detrimental to the team" after he shot 3-for-14 in an Oct. 31 loss to the Los Angeles Lakers.
ESPN's Shams Charania reported the suspension was due to Morant's response to Iisalo "challenging Morant's leadership and effort" following the loss.
When asked after his return to the team if he still had "joy," Morant told reporters, "No."
That apparent discontent with the Grizzlies has led to rumors the star could be traded prior to the Feb. 5 deadline this season.
Morant is signed for two more seasons after the 2025-26 campaign, and he's averaged at least 23 points and four assists in each of the last four seasons.
He's also missed significant time due to injuries or suspension over that span. ESPN's Tim Bontemps also reported last week that although Morant is "viewed as a borderline top-10" point guard, there "aren't many teams around the league" in need of a starter at the position.
Bontemps additionally noted Morant "also remains very popular in Memphis, a market players aren't exactly flocking to, and one in which Morant has repeatedly said he wants to remain."
That desire to stay in Memphis might have contributed to Morant's brushing off the call to move to Manhattan despite his struggles early in Iisalo's first full season at the helm.

Frustration is mounting for the Golden State Warriors after suffering their fifth loss in the last seven games on Tuesday night with a 126-102 defeat against the Oklahoma City Thunder.
Speaking to reporters after the game, Draymond Green cited "personal agendas" and questioned his teammates' commitment to winning as the biggest difference between their struggles to start this season compared to how successful they were down the stretch last season after acquiring Jimmy Butler.
"I think everybody was committed to winning [back then] and doing that any way possible," Green said. "Right now, it doesn't feel that way."
Green did note "everyone has a personal agenda" in the NBA, but the best teams are able to make those work within the structure of the group:
"I think everyone has a personal agenda in this league. But you have to make those personal agendas work within the team confines. If it doesn't work, you kind of got to get rid of your agenda or eventually the agenda is the cause of someone getting rid of you."
It was made clear by Green that he wasn't singling out any one person specifically because "everyone" has to bear the burden of responsibility for how the Warriors are playing right now.
There are some logical reasons that explain why Golden State has stumbled after a 4-1 start. Stephen Curry missed three straight games with an illness before returning on Tuesday, but he scored just 11 points in 20 minutes against Oklahoma City.
Al Horford has been in and out of the lineup due to toe and foot injuries. The Warriors have the second-oldest roster in the NBA by average age this season, with three of their top five starters in at least their age-35 season (Green, Curry, Butler).
The most concerning thing for the Warriors is their offensive output has cratered from last season. They had the ninth-best rating in the NBA over their final 32 games after acquiring Butler, but they sit at 21st through 12 games this season.
Golden State's defense is still a top-10 unit by rating, so the hope will be that getting Curry back at full strength will provide a boost to the offense over time.
If things don't turn around soon, a season that started with high expectations could turn into a disaster for a Warriors team trying to maintain a competitive window in the final years with Curry and Green.

--- Summary ---
Los Angeles Lakers star LeBron James is taking another step in his rehab from sciatica.

--- Full Text ---
Los Angeles Lakers star LeBron James is taking another step in his rehab from sciatica.
Per ESPN's Shams Charania , the Lakers assigned James to their G League team on Wednesday so that he can participate in his first full five-on-five practice as he ramps up his on-court activities.
James missed the start of the 2025-26 season after developing sciatica early in training camp.
While the Lakers didn't put a timetable on his recovery, head coach JJ Redick announced on Nov. 10 that the 40-year-old will begin practicing with the team's G League affiliate in South Bay in preparation for his 23rd NBA season, which will set a new league record for most seasons played.
One reason for James to practice with the South Bay Lakers is the NBA club is in the midst of a five-game road trip that runs through Saturday. The Lakers' next home game is on Nov. 18 against the Utah Jazz.
Despite missing one of their best players, the Lakers started the year with an 8-3 record. Star guard Luka Dončić has been on a tear with averages of 37.1 points, 9.1 assists and 9.4 rebounds per game in seven starts. He's been supported by rising star Austin Reaves, who has started out hot with 30.3 points on 48.0 percent shooting.
While James is nearing the end of his legendary career, he's shown that he still has a lot left in the tank. He's coming off a strong 2024-25 campaign in which he played 70 games and averaged 24.4 points, 7.8 rebounds and 8.2 assists.
If James is anywhere close to his usual form, the Lakers will have a strong chance to be one of the top contenders in the Western Conference. Adding him next to Doncic and Reaves would create a dangerous trio that can carry Los Angeles to the NBA Finals.
However, it makes sense that the Lakers won't rush James back into the lineup as he continues his recovery. Forwards Rui Hachimura, Jarred Vanderbilt and Jake LaRavia will continue to see extended minutes until James is able to return.
As James prepares to start practicing in the G League, the rest of the Lakers are in Oklahoma City on Wednesday night for a marquee matchup with the reigning NBA champion Thunder.

Θεσσαλία: Έκτακτη σύγκληση της Επιτροπής Παραγωγής και Εμπορίου ζητά ο ΣΥΡΙΖΑ για τα έργα αποκατάστασης
Αίτημα να κατατεθούν πλήρη και διαφανή στοιχεία για την πορεία των έργων, τα κονδύλια, τις πηγές χρηματοδότησης και τον επιμερισμό αρμοδιοτήτων μεταξύ κυβέρνησης και περιφέρειας.
Αίτημα για έκτακτη σύγκληση της Επιτροπής Παραγωγής και Εμπορίου της Βουλής αναφορικά με την πορεία των έργων αποκατάστασης των περιοχών που επλήγησαν από τις πλημμύρες στη Θεσσαλία κατέθεσε ο ΣΥΡΙΖΑ.
Το αίτημα, που υπογράφεται από τους βουλευτές του ΣΥΡΙΖΑ–ΠΣ και μέλη της αρμόδιας Επιτροπής, Βασίλη Κόκκαλη, Μίλτο Ζαμπάρα, Χάρη Μαμουλάκη, Αλέξανδρο Μεϊκόπουλο και Νίκο Παππά, ζητά την άμεση ενημέρωση της Επιτροπής για την πορεία υλοποίησης των έργων αποκατάστασης των ζημιών από τα πλημμυρικά φαινόμενα “Daniel” και “Elias” στη Θεσσαλία.
Οι βουλευτές ζητούν να προσκληθούν στην Επιτροπή: ο Περιφερειάρχης Θεσσαλίας, κ. Δημήτρης Κουρέτας, οι δήμαρχοι των πλημμυρόπληκτων περιοχών και οι συναρμόδιοι υπουργοί προκειμένου να καταθέσουν πλήρη και διαφανή στοιχεία για την πορεία των έργων, τα κονδύλια, τις πηγές χρηματοδότησης και τον επιμερισμό αρμοδιοτήτων μεταξύ κυβέρνησης και περιφέρειας.
«Η ανάγκη θεσμικής ενημέρωσης και διαφάνειας είναι πλέον επιτακτική. Έναν χρόνο μετά τις καταστροφικές πλημμύρες, οι πολίτες της Θεσσαλίας δικαιούνται να γνωρίζουν ποια έργα έχουν προχωρήσει, ποια έχουν καθυστερήσει και ποιος φέρει την ευθύνη για τις καθυστερήσεις» σημειώνει η Κουμουνδούρου, προσθέτοντας την ανάγκη διασφάλισης της λογοδοσίας και της αποτελεσματικής αποκατάστασης των πληγεισών περιοχών.

Βοιωτία: Μυστήριο με τον θάνατο του 27χρονου – «Του δώσανε στίγμα και πήγε στα Βίλια»
Στο μικροσκόπιο η διαδρομή που ακολούθησε.
Στο μικροσκόπιο η διαδρομή που ακολούθησε.
Πυκνό μυστήριο καλύπτει τον θάνατο του 27χρονου οικοδόμου εντοπίστηκε απανθρακωμένος σε εγκαταλελειμμένο όχημα στα Σκούρτα Βοιωτίας. Οι Αρχές προσπαθούν να ενώσουν τα κομμάτια του παζλ για το τί συνέβη εκείνη την ημέρα.
Η διαδρομή που φέρεται να ακολούθησε βρίσκεται στο μικροσκόπιο των Αρχών, όπως και οι απειλές που ενδεχομένως να δέχτηκε. Ωστόσο, την υπόθεση καλύπτει ένα πέπλο μυστηρίου καθώς ο αντάρες είχε λευκό ποινικό μητρώο.
«Έφυγε από το σπίτι του 4 Νοεμβρίου, πήγε στα Βίλια, στα Βίλια πήρε τηλέφωνο τη γυναίκα του, της είπε ότι περιμένει το ραντεβού του, μετά το τηλέφωνό του έκλεισε. Την Παρασκευή ένας κυνηγός εντόπισε ένα καμένο αυτοκίνητο, μέσα στο αυτοκίνητο ήταν ο 27χρονος, ειδοποιήθηκε η αστυνομία και έκτοτε έγινε η ταυτοποίηση. Βρέθηκε στο πίσω μέρος του αυτοκινήτου, υπάρχει μία σφαίρα και το αυτοκίνητο προφανώς κάηκε για να καούν τα ίχνη», είπε στο Mega, ο Γεράσιμος Κουρούκλης, Διοικητής Υπηρεσίας Silver Alert.
Οι υποθέσεις οργανωμένου εγκλήματος καταλήγουν κάπως έτσι, με ένα καμένο αυτοκίνητο. Μάλιστα το συγκεκριμένο αυτοκίνητο το είχαν κλέψει πριν από 1 χρόνο στην Γλυφάδα.
Οι συγγενείς του 27χρονου θρηνούν και ζητούν απαντήσεις.
«Είμαστε χάλια. Δεν μπορώ να καταλάβω, δεν μπορώ να καταλάβω ούτε και εγώ σαν θείος. Ο ανιψιός μου δεν μιλούσε με τίποτα. Την Τρίτη το απόγευμα έφυγε. Άμα ήξερα που θα πήγαινε, θα είχα πάει και εγώ πίσω του. Δεν το ήξερα, ούτε εγώ. Έχει δύο παιδιά, μικρά, ενός μήνα είναι το παιδί του. Θέλει βοήθεια (η γυναίκα του) που θα βρούμε τη βοήθεια εμείς; Και τα παιδιά του. Μένουνε τώρα στον δρόμο, άστα να πάνε τώρα. Δεν είχανε πρόβλημα, ρώτησα και την κοπέλα εγώ, μου λέει δεν είχαν θέμα, τίποτα λέει. Όπως τον γνωρίζω εγώ, σαν ανιψιό μου ήταν δουλειά, σπίτι, δουλειά, σπίτι, τώρα δεν ξέρω», λέει ο θείος
Ο άντρας έφυγε από το σπίτι του με κατεύθυνση τα Βίλια Αττικής. Επικοινώνησε με τη σύζυγό του, την ενημέρωσε ότι έχει φτάσει στα Βίλια και περιμένει έναν φίλο του. Το φιλικό του περιβάλλον λέει ότι θα συναντούσε μία κυρία, την οποία είχε γνωρίσει το τελευταίο διάστημα μέσω TikTok.
Το όχημά του εντοπίστηκε παρκαρισμένο στην είσοδο γηπέδου μπάσκετ στα Βίλια Αττικής ενώ εντός του οχήματος βρέθηκαν μόνο τα τσιγάρα του και μία ζακέτα.
Παράλληλα, σύμφωνα με τις πληροφορίες, η σύζυγος του 27χρονου κατά τη κατάθεσή της στις Αρχές ρωτήθηκε για ο γυναικείο προφίλ στο TikTok ενώ υπέδειξε και τα πρόσωπα που έρχονταν σε επαφή το τελευταίο διάστημα με τον σύζυγό της.
Ταυτόχρονα, αποκάλυψε πως ο σύζυγός της είχε δεχτεί απειλητικά μηνύματα πριν από 3 χρόνια από τον πρώην σύντροφό της, ο οποίος, όπως λέει, ήταν ζηλιάρης όμως δεν είχαν πιαστεί ποτέ στα χέρια. Η ίδια παρέδωσε και τα δύο δικά της κινητά.
Ο θείος του προσθέτει στο Live News:
-Έχει βρεθεί το DNA είναι το δικό του. Δεν μας πηγαίνει καθόλου το μυαλό, δεν μας πηγαίνει πουθενά, ήταν δουλευταράς, ήταν εργατικός, δεν ξέρουμε αν είχε μπλέξει, αν είχε… Δεν ξέρουμε τίποτα. Έχουμε μείνει κόκαλο όλοι.
-Δεχόταν απειλές από κάποιον;
-Όχι, όχι, όχι από κανέναν. Δεν μας είχε πει τίποτα και σίγουρα θα μας έλεγε. Δεν είχε απασχολήσει τις Aρχές, ούτε μας είχε δώσει τέτοια δικαιώματα.
-Πήγαινε προς τα Βίλια. Ούτε ο ίδιος δεν ήξερε εκεί πέρα το μέρος, με GPS πήγε. Του δώσανε στίγμα και πήγε με GPS εκεί πέρα. Πήγε εκεί και δεν γύρισε, θα γυρνούσε μετά από καμιά ώρα και δεν γύρισε. Κάποιον πήγε να βρει εκεί πέρα.
Η οικογένειά του παραμένει συγκλονισμένη και ζητά να βρεθούν ποιοι κρύβονται πίσω από το αποτρόπαιο έγκλημα που άφησε έναν άνθρωπο νεκρό και μια οικογένεια διαλυμένη.
Σύμφωνα με τον Βασίλη Λαμπρόπουλο, αστυνομικό συντάκτη των εφημερίδων «ΤΟ ΒΗΜΑ» και «ΤΑ ΝΕΑ», η έρευνα των Αρχών εστιάζεται στα Βίλια, εκεί που βρέθηκε εγκαταλελειμμένο το όχημά του.
Μέσα από βιντεοληπτικό υλικό από κάμερες ασφαλείας αλλά και από μαρτυρίες, οι Αρχές προσπαθούν να εντοπίσουν τί συνέβη εκείνη την ημέρα και ποιος άρπαξε τον 27χρονο από το σημείο.
Παράλληλα, ο αστυνομικός συντάκτης είπε πως δεν φαίνεται να εμπλέκεται ο 27χρονος με οργανωμένα κυκλώματα ναρκωτικών ή όπλων ενώ αποκλείεται και η εμπλοκή του σε δολοφονία ενός ποινικού πριν από μερικές ημέρες.
Επιπλέον, όπως είπε ο Βασίλης Λαμπρόπουλος, το όνομά του είναι ίδιο με το όνομα ενός ατόμου με σοβαρή ποινική δραστηριότητα, το οποίος εμπλέκεται σε πολλές δολοφονίες.
Σύμφωνα με τον δικηγόρο της οικογένειάς του, Αλέξανδρο Παπαϊωαννίδη, το ενδεχόμενο να σκότωσαν τον 27χρονο κατά λάθος επειδή είχε το ίδιο όνομα με έναν ποινικό, δεν φαίνεται να ευσταθεί.

Ενδοοικογενειακή βία στο Μιλάνο: 46χρονος επιχείρησε να κάψει τη σύζυγό του με βενζίνη
Ο 46χρονος παρέδωσε στις Αρχές ένα κουτί με σύστημα εντοπισμού GPS, το οποίο είχε εγκαταστήσει στο αυτοκίνητο της συζύγου του για να την παρακολουθεί.
Ο 46χρονος παρέδωσε στις Αρχές ένα κουτί με σύστημα εντοπισμού GPS, το οποίο είχε εγκαταστήσει στο αυτοκίνητο της συζύγου του για να την παρακολουθεί.
Εφιαλτικές στιγμές έζησε μια γυναίκα στο Μιλάνο, όταν δέχθηκε επίθεση από τον πρώην σύντροφό της, ο οποίος την ακινητοποίησε και την περιέλουσε με βενζίνη.
Σύμφωνα με πληροφορίες, το ζευγάρι αντιμετώπιζε προβλήματα στη σχέση τους, καθώς ο 46χρονος φέρεται να προχωρούσε σε λεκτικές και σωματικές επιθέσεις κατά της σύντροφό του. Από την άλλη, εκείνη προχώρησε σε αίτηση διαζυγίου, ενώ είχε ήδη μετακομίσει.
Ωστόσο, το περιστατικό ενδοοικογενειακής βίας σημειώθηκε στις 5 Νοεμβρίου, όταν ο 46χρονος την περίμενε στην έξοδο από τον χώρο εργασίας της, όπου την ακινητοποίησε μπροστά στο αυτοκίνητό της, την απείλησε και της πέταξε βενζίνη στο πρόσωπο. Τότε, η γυναίκα τρομοκρατημένη, κατάφερε να μπει μέσα στο όχημά της και να κλειδωθεί, καλώντας σε βοήθεια.
Λίγο αργότερα, ο δράστης παρουσιάστηκε μόνος του στις Αρχές, παραδίδοντας έναν αναπτήρα, το κινητό του τηλέφωνο και δύο μπουκάλια που περιείχαν διαφανές υγρό, πιθανότατα βενζίνη. Παρέδωσε επίσης ένα κουτί με σύστημα εντοπισμού GPS, το οποίο, όπως παραδέχθηκε, είχε εγκαταστήσει στο αυτοκίνητο της συζύγου του για να την παρακολουθεί.
Ακόμα ο 46χρονος συνελήφθη, με κατηγορίες για κακοποίηση και πρόκληση σωματικών βλαβών στη σύζυγό του, η οποία είχε ζητήσει να χωρίσουν.
Σύμφωνα με την εισαγγελική έρευνα και τις καταθέσεις της γυναίκας και των συγγενών της, ο άνδρας είχε επανειλημμένα επιτεθεί στη σύζυγό του, συχνά υπό την επήρεια αλκοόλ, τόσο λεκτικά όσο και σωματικά, ακόμη και παρουσία των παιδιών τους. Η γυναίκα ζούσε για μήνες υπό καθεστώς τρόμου και ταπείνωσης, έχοντας ήδη καταθέσει μήνυση εις βάρος του τον περασμένο Ιούνιο.

Λάρισα: Έπεσαν λάμπες από το ταβάνι σχολείου σε ώρα μαθήματος
Τι καταγγέλλουν οι γονείς.
Τι καταγγέλλουν οι γονείς.
Ανησυχία και αγανάκτηση επικρατεί στο 1ο Δημοτικό Σχολείο Λάρισας, καθώς ο Σύλλογος Γονέων και Κηδεμόνων καταγγέλλει ότι μέσα σε λίγους μήνες καταγράφτηκαν δύο περιστατικά, κατά τα οποία έπεσαν λάμπες από το ταβάνι εν ώρα μαθήματος.
Σύμφωνα με το onlarissa.gr, πτώσεις λαμπτήρων μέσα σε αίθουσες διδασκαλίας και υποδομές χωρίς τις απαραίτητες συντηρήσεις έχουν θέσει σε κίνδυνο την ασφάλεια μαθητών και εκπαιδευτικών, ενώ –όπως επισημαίνεται– παρά τα επανειλημμένα αιτήματα προς τον Δήμο, δεν έχει υπάρξει καμία ουσιαστική παρέμβαση.
«Το Διοικητικό Συμβούλιο του Συλλόγου Γονέων του 1ου Δημοτικού Σχολείου Λάρισας εκφράζει την οργή και την αγωνία του για τα επαναλαμβανόμενα περιστατικά επικινδυνότητας στο σχολικό μας κτίριο.
Μέσα σε λίγους μήνες, δύο φορές έπεσε λάμπα μέσα σε αίθουσα διδασκαλίας, και τις δύο φορές κατά τη διάρκεια μαθήματος. Ευτυχώς, αποφύγαμε τα χειρότερα από καθαρή τύχη!
Το γεγονός αυτό, ωστόσο, αποκαλύπτει μια πραγματικότητα που δεν μπορεί να συνεχιστεί! Τα παιδιά μας φοιτούν σε κτίρια παλιά, ασυντήρητα και επικίνδυνα.
Παρά τις επαναλαμβανόμενες προειδοποιήσεις του Συλλόγου Γονέων και του Διευθυντή του Σχολείου προς τον Δήμο Λαρισαίων και τις αρμόδιες υπηρεσίες, για την τραγική κατάσταση και πολλά αιτήματα για αλλαγή των λαμπών, καμία ουσιαστική παρέμβαση δεν έχει γίνει. Η ασφάλεια των μαθητών δεν μπορεί να υπολογίζεται με λογιστικούς όρους και με «αναμονή κονδυλίων».
Η αδιαφορία αυτή είναι ανεπίτρεπτη!
Η ασφάλεια των μαθητών και των εκπαιδευτικών δεν είναι διαπραγματεύσιμη και δεν μπορεί να υπολογίζεται με βάση τη “δυνατότητα χρηματοδότησης”.
Το περιστατικό αυτό δεν είναι απλώς ένα “τεχνικό πρόβλημα”, είναι το αποτέλεσμα της συνεχούς υποχρηματοδότησης της δημόσιας εκπαίδευσης. Τα σχολεία μας αντιμετωπίζονται ως κόστος, οι ανάγκες των μαθητών ως περιττές δαπάνες, και οι γονείς καλούνται συνεχώς να βάλουν το χέρι στην τσέπη για να λειτουργούν τα σχολεία, να συμμετέχουμε σε εράνους, να αγοράζουμε υλικά και να καλύπτουμε ελλείψεις που θα έπρεπε να είναι ευθύνη του κράτους.
Η ασφάλεια, η μόρφωση και η αξιοπρέπεια των παιδιών μας δεν είναι πολυτέλεια, είναι δικαίωμα!
Θα συνεχίσουμε να διεκδικούμε ό,τι αξίζει στα παιδιά μας!».

Διακινούσαν ναρκωτικά με drones από το Μαρόκο στην Ισπανία
Εννέα μέλη έχουν συλληφθεί.
Εννέα μέλη έχουν συλληφθεί.
Στην εξάρθρωση ενός δικτύου διακίνησης ναρκωτικών που χρησιμοποιούσε αυτοσχέδια μη επανδρωμένα αεροσκάφη, για να μεταφέρουν κάνναβη από το Μαρόκο προς την Ισπανία, προχώρησε η ισπανική αστυνομία, συλλαμβάνοντας εννέα μέλη.
Σύμφωνα με δελτίο Τύπου της ισπανικής πολιτοφυλακής, τα μη επανδρωμένα αεροσκάφη ήταν ικανά να διασχίσουν περισσότερα από 200 χιλιόμετρα, καθώς απογειώνονταν από τη νότια Ισπανία προκειμένου να παραλάβουν τα ναρκωτικά στο Μαρόκο και, κατά την επιστροφή τους, μετέφεραν το φορτίο στις κοινότητες Βεχέρ ντε λα Φροντέρα και Ταρίφα, στη νότια Ανδαλουσία.
Τα πακέτα έφεραν φωσφορίζοντα διακριτικά και μέσα γεωεντοπισμού μέσω ραδιοσυχνοτήτων προκειμένου να διευκολυνθεί η ανεύρεσή τους κατά τη διάρκεια της νύχτας, όπως διευκρίνισαν οι αρχές.
«Η ομάδα ήταν ικανή να αναπτύσσει αυτοσχέδιους μηχανισμούς μεγάλης αυτονομίας, ακρίβειας και φόρτωσης, πολύ ανώτερους από τα συμβατικά εμπορικά μοντέλα», επισημαίνεται στο δελτίο Τύπου της ισπανικής αστυνομίας.
Το δίκτυο επιχειρούσε σχεδόν κάθε νύχτα, εκτοξεύοντας έως και 10 ντρόουν ταυτόχρονα, κάτι που του επέτρεπε να μεταφέρει περίπου 200 κιλά κάνναβης συνολικά. Η επιχείρηση διεξήχθη σε συνεργασία με τη μαροκινή αστυνομία, αφού οι αρχές εντόπισαν πολλές πτήσεις άγνωστης προέλευσης drone μεταξύ των δύο χωρών.
Συνολικά, οκτώ λειτουργικά ντρόουν και άλλα 10 υπό κατασκευή κατασχέθηκαν, κατά τη διάρκεια ερευνών τη Δευτέρα, όπως και περισσότερα από 150 κιλά κάνναβης και το ποσό των 320.000 ευρώ.

Ο Βασίλης Βλαχόπουλος γράφει για τις φετινές επιδόσεις του Λορέν Μορόν και την ανάγκη υποστήριξης του Ισπανού επιθετικού από τους τωρινούς συμπαίκτες του αλλά και από τις μεταγραφικές αναζητήσεις του Άρη ενόψει του Γενάρη.

--- Full Text ---
Κακό πράγμα η «επίσκεψη» σε ποδοσφαιρικό γήπεδο δίχως τη δυνατότητα απόλαυσης της πεμπτουσίας αυτού του αθλήματος. Προφανώς δεν είναι μόνο αυτός ο λόγος της εκκωφαντικής απουσίας του κόσμου από τις κερκίδες του «Κλ. Βικελίδης». Είναι βαθύτερος ή μάλλον πιο ουσιαστικός και σαφής ως προς την ανάγκη ολοκλήρωσης μιας εποχής και την έναρξη μιας άλλης. Τούτο όμως (επί του προσωπικού) θα απασχολήσει όταν προκύψει κάτι χειροπιαστό. Δεν υπάρχει καμία πρόθεση υπεκφυγής, είναι ζήτημα δημοσιογραφικής αντίληψης ή μάλλον κοσμοθεωρίας. Ακόμη και στην αλλαγή του ιδιοκτησιακού καθεστώτος στην ΚΑΕ Άρης, σε τούτη τη γωνιά δεν είχατε διαβάσει το παραμικρό απ’ όσα φημολογούνταν και τα οποία ήταν ανάξια καταγραφής. Τα διαβάσατε όλα μόλις εμφανίστηκε αυτός που είχε πρόθεση να αποκτήσει την εταιρία, πριν φτάσει το περιβόητο letter of intent, ως επικύρωση των πληροφοριών. Εκεί η μελάνη (ηλεκτρονικής μορφής) απλώθηκε στις αντίστοιχες φόρμες. Σε πραγματικό χρόνο, όπως επιβάλλουν οι συνθήκες της εποχής.
Προς το παρόν λοιπόν, μένω στην πεμπτουσία που αναζητείται. Πέρυσι τέτοια εποχή και πριν από τον αλησμόνητο αγώνα στο Αγρίνιο, ο Άρης βρισκόταν στην πρώτη θέση. Λόγω και αδυναμίας των ισχυρότερων σε όλα τα επίπεδα (;), προφανώς έπαιξε ρόλο. Περισσότερο όμως επειδή ο ίδιος έδειχνε πιο ουσιαστικός και ξεκάθαρος σ’ αυτό που ήθελε να προσφέρει. Στην επίθεση δεν πετούσε φωτιές, αν και τα συνολικά τέρματά του ήταν περί του 50% περισσότερα (14) από τα φετινά εννιά που στοιχειοθετούν πενιχρή επίδοση.
Τα κέφια του Λορέν Μορόν είχαν φωτίσει ένα λαμπερό μονοπάτι. Οκτώ γκολ είχε πετύχει έως και τη 10η αγωνιστική. Τα τετραπλάσια σε σύγκριση με τα φετινά δύο, δείγμα της απώλειας έως και της σπουδαιότερης «σταθεράς» του γκρουπ. Ο Ισπανός μοιάζει βαρύς κι ασήκωτος, αρκετά ξενερωμένος μ’ αυτό που αντιλαμβάνεται και διαπιστώνει, δίχως τούτο να σημαίνει ότι η ευθύνη του είναι περιορισμένη. Ίσα-ίσα που είναι αρκετά μεγάλη γιατί στην 3η χρονιά του στην ομάδα θα περίμενε κανείς να φανερώσει ηγετική προσωπικότητα δίχως να χρειάζεται κάποιος να χτυπάει το σαμάρι. Ωστόσο, ηγέτες σε μια ομάδα δεν είναι πάντα οι πρώτοι σκόρερ. Είναι αυτοί που το λέει η ψυχούλα τους.
Η απώλεια αυτής της «σταθεράς» σε συνδυασμό με τον… κατακλυσμό των τραυματισμών είτε λόγω ατυχίας είτε γιατί αποκτήθηκαν ποδοσφαιριστές με προβληματικό μυϊκό σύστημα με φυσική συνέπεια τα διαδοχικά προβλήματα, οδήγησε στην κατάσταση που διαχειρίζεται εδώ και δύο μήνες ο Μανόλο Χιμένεθ. Όπως και στην παραδοχή περί ανάγκης ενίσχυσης του ποιοτικού επιπέδου της ομάδας. Περί μεταγραφών θα γραφτεί άλλο κείμενο, προς το παρόν όμως είναι απαραίτητο να αναγνωριστεί η ανάγκη υποστήριξης του μοναδικού παίκτη που πρόσφερε το γκολ. Με τα καλά και τα στραβά του, τουλάχιστον αυτή τη δουλειά την έκανε και με το παραπάνω. Άλλες δεν κάνει κι αυτό ενοχλεί τους προπονητές και το κοινό. Αν τις έκανε, δεν θα ήταν στην Ελλάδα αλλά θα έπαιζε σε πρωτοκλασάτη ισπανική ομάδα.
Ο Άρης έχασε τη σταθερά του και με δική του ευθύνη. Γιατί χρειάζεται να παίζει στο αριστερό άκρο της επίθεσης μ’ έναν ποδοσφαιριστή (σ. σ. Πιόνε Σίστο) ο οποίος ήταν εκτός πλάνου και ήθελε να τον «ξεφορτωθεί» το περασμένο καλοκαίρι. Έναν ακραίο επιθετικό δίχως γκολ παρά τις 32 συμμετοχές του. Γιατί δεν πήρε τίποτε ούτε ένα γκολ ούτε από τον άλλον βασικό ακραίο επιθετικό του (σ. σ. Ντιαντί) πριν αυτός παραχωρηθεί σε άλλες Πολιτείες.
Γιατί δεν παίρνει δημιουργία και επιθετικό παιχνίδι από τον ποδοσφαιριστή πίσω από τον Λορέν Μορόν καθώς ο Κώστας Γαλανόπουλος δεν έχει τα στοιχεία να το προσφέρει ενώ ο Μορουτσάν (μέχρι στιγμής) αποδεικνύεται κατώτερος των περιστάσεων και της επένδυσης. Κι έτσι ο Άρης μοιάζει η πιο εύκολα διαχειρίσιμη ομάδα για κάθε αντίπαλη άμυνα. Όλες εστιάζουν στον Μορόν νιώθοντας τη βεβαιότητα ότι δεν υφίσταται άλλος κίνδυνος.
Αυτό έχει τη σημασία του ενόψει της μεταγραφικής περιόδου του Γενάρη γιατί αποδείχθηκε λανθασμένο το σκεπτικό της απόκτησης ενός ακραίου επιθετικού ή φορ με τη λογική ότι θα βρει στον Άρη αυτό που δεν είχε στο σύνολο της καριέρας του. Το γκολ. Με 17 γκολ σε βάθος πενταετίας, όπως έχουν τρεις εκ των παικτών που αποκτήθηκαν με σκοπό να συνθέσουν τη βασική επιθετική γραμμή, δεν λογίζεσαι και «εκτελεστής». Αυτή η επίδοση αναδεικνύει ότι το γκολ αποτελεί το βασικό σου αγωνιστικό ζήτημα.
Ενόψει του Γενάρη, ο Άρης χρειάζεται ποδοσφαιριστές οι οποίοι δεν θα κουμπώσουν απλά σε μια τακτική προσέγγιση, αλλά θα έχουν κι αυτό το ρημάδι το γκολ μπας και εμπλουτιστεί η μεθοδολογία αυτής της ομάδας όταν έχει την μπάλα στα πόδια της…

Ένα αδιανόητο πόστερ έκανε ο Κρις Σίλβα, στην αναμέτρηση της ΑΕΚ με τη Ρίγα για την 4η αγωνιστική του BCL.

Ο Κρις Σίλβα χάρισε το κάρφωμα της αγωνιστικής ή και της... σεζόν όπως έγραψε ο λογαριασμός του BCL. Η ΑΕΚ υποδέχεται τη Ρίγα στην 4η αγωνιστική του BCL, με τον σέντερ των «κιτρινόμαυρων» να ίπταται προς το καλάθι των αντιπάλων.
Μετά από ένα επιθετικό ριμπάουντ και την ασίστ του Μιντάουγκας Κουζμίνσκας, ο Κρις Σίλβα πάτησε πολύ μακριά από το καλάθι και με το ένα χέρι έκανε πόστερ τον αντίπαλό του.
«Μη σκρολάρετε περισσότερο, βρήκαμε το κάρφωμα της σεζόν» ανέφερε στον λογαριασμό του στο twitter το BCL.

Η μεγάλη επιστροφή του Κίναν Έβανς σε 12άδα αναμέτρησης EuroLeague είναι γεγονός. Ο Ολυμπιακός υποδέχεται τη Ζάλγκιρις (21:15, Live στο Gazzetta), την πρώην ομάδα του Αμερικανού, με εκείνον να βρίσκεται στη 12άδα, όπως είχε προαναγγείλει ο Γιώργος Μπαρτζώκας.
Ο Φρανκ Νιλικίνα αντιμετωπίζει ένα πρόβλημα στους οπίσθιους μηριαίους και έτσι ο Κίναν Έβανς, μετά την επιστροφή του στην αναμέτρηση με την Καρδίτσα, μπήκε στους 12 του Ολυμπιακού για τη 10η αγωνιστική της EuroLeague.
Πέραν του τραυματία Φρανκ Νιλικίνα, ο Γιώργος Μπαρτζώκας άφησε εκτός επίσης τους Γιαννούλη Λαρεντζάκη, Όμηρο Νετζήπογλου και Κώστα Αντετοκούνμπο.

--- Summary ---
Σύμφωνα με όσα αναφέρονται σε γαλλικό δημοσίευμα η ΕΠΟ προσέγγισε για τον πάγκο της Εθνικής Ελλάδας τον Ιταλοβραζιλιάνο τεχνικό Τιάγκο Μότα.

--- Full Text ---
Ο Τιάγκο Μότα περιμένει ακόμη τη νέα του μεγάλη πρόκληση.
Μετά την εντυπωσιακή του πορεία στη Μπολόνια και ένα σύντομο πέρασμα από τη Γιουβέντους, ο Ιταλοβραζιλιάνος τεχνικός παραμένει χωρίς ομάδα από τον Μάρτιο, αν και οι επαφές του με την Αταλάντα συνεχίζονται. Σύμφωνα με τα όσα αναφέρονται σε δημοσίευμα του footmercato, πάντως, ενδιαφέρον υπήρξε κι από την ΕΠΟ. Στο ρεπορτάζ τονίστηκε ότι τον προσέγγισε η ελληνική ποδοσφαιρική ομοσπονδία, προκειμένου ν' αναλάβει την Εθνική ομάδα.
Αναλυτικά το δημοσίευμα: «Μετά την απίστευτη και ιστορική πορεία του με τη Μπολόνια, ο Τιάγκο Μότα φαινόταν έτοιμος για ένα λαμπρό μέλλον. Ο τεχνικός, γνωστός για το ελκυστικό και ομαδικό ποδόσφαιρο που οδήγησε τους «Ροσομπλού» μέχρι μια ανέλπιστη πρόκριση στο Champions League, ανέλαβε στη συνέχεια τη Γιουβέντους, διαδεχόμενος τον Μασιμιλιάνο Αλέγκρι.
Οι πρώτες του εμφανίσεις στο Τορίνο έδειξαν μια νέα, πιο σύγχρονη Γιουβέντους, προσανατολισμένη στην κατοχή και την κάθετη ανάπτυξη. Ωστόσο, η συνεργασία έληξε πρόωρα: μια σειρά κακών αποτελεσμάτων στη Serie A και μια έντονη σύγκρουση με τον αθλητικό διευθυντή Κριστιάνο Τζουντόλι έφεραν το ξαφνικό τέλος. Ο τελευταίος μάλιστα αποχώρησε στη συνέχεια από τη θέση του, αποδεικνύοντας πόσο γρήγορα αλλάζουν τα πράγματα στο ποδόσφαιρο.
Μέσα σε λίγους μήνες, ο Μότα πέρασε από τον τίτλο του «προπονητή-θαύματος» που πολιορκούσαν οι μεγάλες ευρωπαϊκές ομάδες, σε εκείνον του ανθρώπου χωρίς πάγκο. Από τις 23 Μαρτίου 2025, όταν και απολύθηκε, επικρατεί σιωπή γύρω του — μια σιωπή που κρύβει όμως ενδιαφέρον, καθώς ο Μότα παραμένει ένας από τους πιο παρακολουθούμενους τεχνικούς της Ευρώπης.
Παρότι δεν έχει αναλάβει ομάδα, οι φήμες γύρω από το όνομά του φούντωσαν τις τελευταίες εβδομάδες. Στη Γαλλία, το όνομά του συνδέθηκε αρχικά με τη Μονακό μετά την αποχώρηση του Άντι Χίτερ, πριν η ομάδα στραφεί τελικά στον Σεμπαστιέν Ποκογνιόλι. Στην Ισπανία, η Ρεάλ Σοσιεδάδ εξέτασε το ενδεχόμενο να τον προσεγγίσει, καθώς ο Σέρχιο Φρανσίσκο βρισκόταν υπό πίεση λόγω των κακών αποτελεσμάτων.
Πιο πρόσφατα, ένα σενάριο-έκπληξη προέκυψε από την Πολωνία, όπου η Λέγκια Βαρσοβίας φέρεται να τον προσέγγισε για ένα φιλόδοξο μεσοπρόθεσμο πλάνο. Την ίδια στιγμή, φήμες τον ήθελαν να έχει προταθεί στη Γουλβς (Premier League) και στον Άγιαξ, ο οποίος αναζητά νέο προπονητή και σαφή ταυτότητα μετά μήνες αναταραχής και την αποχώρηση του Τζον Χάιτινγκα.
Όλες αυτές οι επαφές επιβεβαιώνουν ότι η φήμη του πρώην μέσου του Παρί Σεν Ζερμέν παραμένει αναλλοίωτη, ακόμη και χωρίς ενεργό ρόλο.
Σύμφωνα με τις πληροφορίες, το ενδιαφέρον του Άγιαξ δεν είναι απλή φήμη. Οι Ολλανδοί έχουν όντως συμπεριλάβει τον Μότα στη λίστα τους και έχει υπάρξει μια πρώτη ανεπίσημη επαφή. Ωστόσο, δεν φαίνεται να είναι ο βασικός υποψήφιος.
Ο ίδιος ο Μότα έχει ξεκάθαρη προτεραιότητα: να επιστρέψει στη Serie A. Ο πρώην προπονητής της Μπολόνια ονειρεύεται ένα σταθερό και ευρωπαϊκών προδιαγραφών πρότζεκτ στην Ιταλία, με την Αταλάντα να παραμένει ο ιδανικός προορισμός. Οι δύο πλευρές είχαν έρθει κοντά το περασμένο καλοκαίρι, μετά την αποχώρηση του Τζαν Πιέρο Γκασπερίνι για τη Ρόμα, και δεν αποκλείεται να ξαναβρεθούν αν επιδεινωθεί η θέση του Ίβαν Γιούριτς.
Παρά τη σπουδαία νίκη της Αταλάντα επί της Μαρσέιγ στο Champions League, τα αποτελέσματα στο πρωτάθλημα δεν είναι ικανοποιητικά και η πίεση αυξάνεται, ιδιαίτερα μετά τη βαριά ήττα (0-3) από τη νεοφώτιστη Σασουόλο εντός έδρας. Αυτή η αβεβαιότητα γύρω από τον πάγκο της Μπέργκαμο φέρεται να «πάγωσε» τις συζητήσεις του Μότα με τη Φιορεντίνα, η οποία τελικά κατέληξε στον Πάολο Βανόλι για τη διαδοχή του Στέφανο Πιόλι, παρότι ο Μότα ήταν στη λίστα των υποψηφίων.
Τους τελευταίους μήνες, ο Τιάγκο Μότα αποφεύγει τα φώτα της δημοσιότητας. Μακριά από τα μέσα ενημέρωσης, προετοιμάζει προσεκτικά την επιστροφή του μαζί με το έμπιστο επιτελείο του: Αλεξάντρ Ιζέ, Σιμόν Κολινέ, Άλφρεντ Ντοσού-Γιοβό, Λάβιο Φρανσίσκο Γκαρσία και Αλεσάντρο Κολασάντε. Όλοι τους έχουν απορρίψει προτάσεις, περιμένοντας μαζί του τον επόμενο μεγάλο σταθμό της καριέρας τους.
Παράλληλα, ορισμένες εθνικές ομοσπονδίες, ανάμεσά τους της Σερβίας και της Ελλάδας, τον προσέγγισαν για τη θέση του ομοσπονδιακού προπονητή, αλλά ο Μότα παραμένει προσηλωμένος στην προοπτική ενός συλλόγου, πιστεύοντας πως το ποδόσφαιρό του αποδίδει καλύτερα στην καθημερινή δουλειά.
Να σημειωθεί επίσης πως Φενέρμπαχτσε και Ρεντ Μπουλ Μπραγκαντίνο είχαν κάνει διερευνητικές επαφές μαζί του στις αρχές της σεζόν.
Αν δεν ανοίξει ξανά η πόρτα της Serie A τις επόμενες εβδομάδες, οι «εναλλακτικές» του είναι σαφείς: η Premier League, για το υψηλό τακτικό επίπεδο και τη μεγάλη προβολή της, και η Ligue 1, πρωτάθλημα που γνωρίζει καλά και όπου αρκετοί σύλλογοι θα εκτιμούσαν το προφίλ του.
Το μόνο σίγουρο είναι ότι η επιστροφή του Τιάγκο Μότα πλησιάζει, και δεν αποκλείεται να γίνει πριν τα Χριστούγεννα, με την Αταλάντα να διατηρεί τον πρώτο λόγο για να τον υπογράψει».

Αυτοκριτική για την τελευταία του σεζόν στη Μπαρτσελόνα έκανε ο Τσάβι, ο οποίος παραδέχθηκε τα λάθη που τον οδήγησαν στην έξοδο από το κλαμπ.

--- Full Text ---
Η εποχή Τσάβι στη Μπαρτσελόνα ξεκίνησε με πολλές υποσχέσεις που προοδευτικά όλο και αυξάνονταν, με αποκορύφωμα τη σεζόν 2022/2023 όταν ο θρύλος των Καταλανών κατάφερε να τους οδηγήσει για πρώτη φορά στην κατάκτηση της La Liga μετά από τέσσερα ολόκληρα χρόνια.
Παρόλα αυτά η σεζόν που ακολούθησε δεν συνδυάστηκε με παρόμοια αποτελέσματα. Το επίπεδο της Μπαρτσελόνα έπεσε, με αποτέλεσμα στο τέλος να μείνει χωρίς τίτλους και ο Τσάβι χωρίς δουλειά... Καιρό μετά την απομάκρυνσή του από τους Μπλαουγκράνα, ο Ισπανός έκανε την αυτοκριτική για τους λόγους που τον οδήγησαν μακριά από το κλαμπ και τις ευθύνες που τον βαραίνουν.
«Ξεκίνησα την προπονητική μου καριέρα στη Μπαρτσελόνα με μεγάλες προσδοκίες — τόσο για τους παίκτες όσο και για τον σύλλογο. Η ομάδα προερχόταν από μια εποχή όπου δεν υπήρχαν πολλές απαιτήσεις», αλλά, όπως παραδέχεται, «το λάθος μου ήταν ότι διατήρησα αυτά τα υψηλά στάνταρ μόνο για έναν χρόνο — από τη στιγμή που έφτασα μέχρι τη στιγμή που κερδίσαμε τη La Liga και το Super Cup Ισπανίας.
Αργότερα, κατάφερα να κάνω αυτοκριτική και είπα στον εαυτό μου: “Διάολε, τι μου συνέβη;''. Είχα χαμηλώσει αυτά τα υψηλά στάνταρ και οι παίκτες δεν είχαν πλέον την ίδια νοοτροπία, τον ίδιο σεβασμό, την ίδια προσπάθεια. Τα στάνταρ συνέχισαν να πέφτουν, μέχρι που, την τελευταία μου σεζόν, δεν κερδίσαμε τίποτα. Έμαθα όμως πολλά από αυτό. Έπρεπε να κάνω την αυτοκριτική μου» τόνισε σε μια διάσκεψη του ESOC University

Το επερχόμενο Παγκόσμιο Κύπελλο θα είναι το μεγαλύτερο της ιστορίας, πρόκειται για τη διευρυμένη έκδοσή του που για πρώτη φορά θα περιλαμβάνει 48 εθνικές ομάδες.
Και για αυτό η FIFA δημιούργησε ένα νεοσύστατο μονοπάτι που υπόσχεται να φέρει στη μεγαλύτερη γιορτή του ποδοσφαίρου χώρες που μέχρι πρότινος μόνο στον... ύπνο τους μπορούσαν να δουν Μουντιάλ. Και τώρα το «βλέπουν» κατάματα με θάρρος και αποφασιστικότητα. Από τη Νέα Καληδονία και τη Βολιβία, μέχρι το Κουρασάο και τα Ηνωμένα Αραβικά Εμιράτα! Ο λόγος για τα διεθνή play-offs.
Τα διεθνή play-offs της FIFA για το Παγκόσμιο Κύπελλο είναι ουσιαστικά ένα μίνι προκριματικό τουρνουά, πριν το πραγματικό τουρνουά. Άλλωστε, θα παίξουν και έναν ρόλο... test drive, για αυτό και τον Μάρτιο του 2026 (23-31) θα διεξαχθούν στο Μεξικό, προκειμένου να γίνει και μια πρόβα τζενεράλε για την κατάσταση των γηπέδων και της οργάνωσης της χώρας της Βόρειας Αμερικής. Σκεφτείτε κάτι σαν εκτεταμένα μπαράζ.
Σε αυτά θα συμμετέχουν έξι συνολικά χώρες, οι οποίες θα διεκδικήσουν δύο εισιτήρια για το Μουντιάλ. Διαδικασία σαν... σφηνάκι, που υπόσχεται μπόλικες συγκινήσεις, αφού τα πάντα θα κριθούν σε τέσσερα παιχνίδια και δύο διαφορετικά brackets.
Οι δύο εθνικές με το υψηλότερο ranking προκρίνονται απευθείας στον έναν από τους δύο τελικούς, ενώ οι υπόλοιπες τέσσερις θα κληρωθούν τυχαία για τους δύο ημιτελικούς. Ουσιαστικά δηλαδή, πρόκειται για δύο ξεχωριστά πρωταθληματάκια με τρεις ομάδες το καθένα. Όλα τα παιχνίδια θα είναι μονά και νοκ-άουτ με παράταση και πέναλτι σε περίπτωση ισοπαλίας.
Φυσικά, σε αυτά τα ιδιαίτερα μπαράζ θα «παλέψουν» μεταξύ τους εθνικές ομάδες που δεν έχουν πάρει απευθείας πρόκριση στο Παγκόσμιο Κύπελλο. Εξαιρουμένης της UEFA, που ούτως ή άλλως έχει τα περισσότερα εισιτήρια για το Μουντιάλ, κάθε άλλη Ομοσπονδία δικαιούται μια θέση στα play-offs. Εκτός από την CONCACAF (Βόρεια και Κεντρική Αμερική), που ως οικοδέσποινα έχει ακόμα μια θέση.
Άρα θα έχουμε: Δύο εθνικές από τη Βόρεια και Κεντρική Αμερική, μια από τη Λατινική Αμερική, μια από την Ασία, μια από την Αφρική και μια από την Ωκεανία.
Από αυτές μέχρι στιγμής είναι κλειδωμένες οι δύο, η Νέα Καληδονία από την Ωκεανία και η Βολιβία από τη Λατινική Αμερική. Σε αυτή τη διακοπή πάντως, θα ξεκαθαρίσει εντελώς το τοπίο.
Στην Ασία θα υπάρξει... εσωτερικός τελικός για τη χώρα που θα πάρει το εισιτήριο για τα play-offs. Δύο παιχνίδια ανάμεσα στα Ηνωμένα Αραβικά Εμιράτα και το Ιράκ (13&18/11).
Στην Αφρική το πράγμα θα κριθεί σε ένα Final Four μονών αγώνων. Οι ημιτελικοί αποτελούνται από τα ζευγάρια Νιγηρία - Γκαμπόν και Καμερούν - Κονγκό (13/11). Οι νικητές θα λύσουν τις διαφορές τους στον τελικό (16/11), από τον οποίο θα προκύψει η αφρικανική εκπρόσωπος των play-offs.
Η CONCACAF «τρέχει» μια ξεχωριστή βαθμολογία ανάμεσα στις τρεις καλύτερες δεύτερες των ομίλων. Από αυτές, οι δύο - βάσει βαθμών - θα πάρουν το εισιτήριο για τα play-offs. Το πράγμα παραμένει ακόμα πολύ ανοιχτό στο συγκεκριμένο κομμάτι. Αυτή τη στιγμή Κουρασάο και Κόστα Ρίκα βρίσκονται σε αυτές τις δύο θέσεις, ωστόσο στις δύο τελευταίες αγωνιστικές τα πάντα μπορούν να αλλάξουν και να δούμε στα play-offs χώρες όπως η Αϊτή, το Τρίνινταντ και Τομπάγκο, το Σουρινάμι, η Γουατεμάλα, το Ελ Σαλβαδόρ, η Ονδούρα και η Τζαμάικα.
Όπως και να έχει, από όλες τις παραπάνω εθνικές ομάδες παραπάνω από μια συμμετοχή σε Παγκόσμιο Κύπελλο έχουν γράψει μόνο η Νιγηρία (6), το Καμερούν (8), η Κόστα Ρίκα (6), η Ονδούρα (3) και η Βολιβία (3). Οι περισσότερες διεκδικήτριες των «χρυσών» εισιτηρίων των play-offs δηλαδή διεκδικούν είτε την πρώτη, είτε τη δεύτερη - μετά από δεκαετίες - συμμετοχής. Ονειρεύονται να γράψουν ιστορία δηλαδή...

--- Summary ---
Thomas Tuchel faces some tough decisions ahead of next year’s World Cup, with the England boss revealing some players will be omitted as they won’t all fit into his playing system. The Three Lions head coach has warned a big-name trio they can’t start a game together as he puts the final touches to his plans ahead of the tournament in the United States, Canada and Mexico.

--- Full Text ---
Many managers would love to enjoy the attacking options at Tuchel’s disposal. The German boss possesses a wealth of talent, but faces the challenge of harmonising them effectively. Harry Kane remains the central figure, though Tuchel must decide how best to integrate other stars. Phil Foden offers versatility, while rising talents like Morgan Rogers and Cole Palmer (injured in recent weeks) challenge for creative midfield spots. The competition for places means the final attacking line-up for the World Cup is far from settled.
The relationship between Tuchel and midfielder Jude Bellingham has been a notable issue. Bellingham was controversially left out of the October squad, with Tuchel citing a need for rhythm and team cohesion. The manager has also publicly commented on Bellingham's aggressive on-field demeanour, suggesting it can be "repulsive" and must be channelled constructively. Bellingham was recalled for the November games, but the saga highlights the pressure on the young dynamo to adapt to Tuchel's structured approach. And that could mean heartbreak for certain stars, with the German tactician saying Kane, Bellingham and Foden "cannot play" together.
Tuchel told talkSPORT: "At the moment, if we keep the structure, they cannot play. They can, but not in the structure, not for the balance that we developed. Not for the structure that also comes with wingers who are like specialists in their positions. At the moment, we play with a No. 6, a No. 8, a No. 10 and a No. 9.
"There is a lot of congruence, especially in the No. 10 position, if you think about Phil can play there, you think about Jude, you think about Morgan Rogers who played fantastic for us in this position. You have Cole Palmer, you have Morgan Gibbs-White, so there are a lot of players, and there is the chance that we will not take everyone. Not because we don't like (them), not because they don't individually deserve it, but we will always do what's best for the team. We will always do what's best for winning, we will always do what's best for balance, and we will try to keep the clarity, even if it means that we have to take tough decisions. We take tough decisions in any camp, and this will not change when we go to a tournament."
When asked if this decision puts Foden’s place under the most jeopardy, Tuchel replied: "Yes and no. If you're a unique player, you can play both positions. I think he can play the No.9, he can play the No.10, it gives him an advantage to compete for both positions. For Man City, he plays almost like a No.8/10, so maybe during the next months, we consider him as a No.8. But again, I see a very, very low percentage that we take five No.10s into a tournament, I don't see how this will help."
England have already qualified for the 2026 World Cup after securing a first-place finish in Group K with two matches to spare. The Three Lions have so far gone unbeaten in their qualification campaign by winning all six of their games and have two final qualifiers coming up against Serbia at Wembley on Thursday and Albania in Tirana on Sunday.

Title       : Endrick's next move decided! Real Madrid finalising loan for out-of-favour wonderkid as Man Utd transfer hopes fade | Goal.com

Published   : 2025-11-12T18:10:06.622Z

--- Summary ---
Real Madrid are close to finalising a loan move for out-of-favour striker Endrick as rumoured suitors Manchester United fall behind in the pursuit of the Brazilian wonderkid. The 19-year-old has struggled to find minutes under Xabi Alonso, and a temporary transfer has been arranged to relaunch his career after a frustrating few months at the Spanish capital.

--- Full Text ---
According to Globo Esporte, Real have approved a deal in principle after lengthy talks with Lyon. The French giants are currently seventh in the Ligue 1 standings under Paulo Fonseca and beat competition from United and Aston Villa, who were exploring late loan offers. The Red Devils wanted to bring the Brazilian in after Benjamin Sesko got injured, but their approach came too late, and Endrick's mind was already made up. The teenager sees Lyon as a platform to rediscover his form, with regular minutes and a starting role that could potentially reignite his hopes of making Brazil’s 2026 World Cup squad.
When Los Blancos secured Endrick from Palmeiras in 2022, in a deal worth up to €60 million (£53m/$70m), he was billed as the next great Brazilian export, following in the footsteps of Vinicius Jr. and Rodrygo. Yet his transition to Europe has not gone to plan. In his debut season under Carlo Ancelotti, he showed flashes of promise, scoring seven goals in 37 appearances, but his second campaign has been derailed by injury and competition. A hamstring problem forced him to miss the Club World Cup and the opening months of the season, and once he regained match fitness, Alonso had moved on to more established names in his roster. To put things into perspective, Endrick has managed just 11 minutes of league football so far in 2025-26, with his lone cameo coming in September’s 4-0 win over Valencia.
"Of course, I’d like him to have played already," the Real Madrid coach admitted. "But the situations in our recent matches have been very tight since Endrick returned. I hope he can get those minutes soon. He’s training well, he’s ready, but the right moment has to come."
The transfer to Lyon will be sealed closer to the January transfer window. Both clubs have agreed to insert a mid-season recall clause allowing Madrid to bring Endrick back if an injury crisis hits the Spanish giants. It is claimed that negotiations began in mid-October, and according to sources close to the player, Endrick himself was eager to make the switch. He has already started house hunting in Lyon, which indicates that personal terms are agreed and only formal paperwork remains to be done. For Lyon, this is being considered a massive coup. Fonseca’s men have struggled for goals this season, with Czech forward Pavel Sulc leading their scoring charts with only five strikes to his name.
Real Madrid have no intention of parting ways permanently with Endrick. The club views the Lyon move as part of his growth plan, similar to how they handled Dani Carvajal’s early development when he was loaned out to Bayer Leverkusen. Sporting director Juni Calafat, who spearheaded the original transfer from Palmeiras, remains convinced Endrick will fulfil his potential in Spain. Madrid had originally preferred to loan him within La Liga, which would have eased his integration into Alonso's squad. Moreover, the forward is just six months away from obtaining a Spanish passport, which was another reason for searching for a club in Spain. But Endrick pushed for a move abroad, prioritising a club that could offer him consistent starts. Carlo Ancelotti, who is now the head coach of the Brazil national team, mentioned that Endrick must rack up minutes to make a case for himself.
"It’s important for Endrick to start playing again," said the Italian coach in an interview with Placar. “I spoke with him at the start of the season. He was injured, but now he’s fine. He needs to think with his team about what’s best, talk with the club, and decide what suits him."
For Endrick, this move could be a defining moment in his career. Lyon offer a stage away from the glare that comes with wearing Madrid's iconic white shirt. It is a club where he can rediscover his sharpness with regular game time. If all goes to plan, the young Brazilian will return to Spain next summer rejuvenated, as there is no buy clause in the loan deal, ready to stake his claim in the Real Madrid starting XI.

Title       : Wayne Rooney backtracks on 'downed tools' criticism of Virgil van Dijk but insists Liverpool skipper should ignore 'noise' & 'focus on his game' amid Reds' struggles | Goal.com
Link        : https://www.goal.com/en/lists/wayne-rooney-backs-down-criticism-virgil-van-dijk-liverpool/blt200ac74032c9f599
Published   : 2025-11-12T18:19:52.535Z

--- Summary ---
After taking time to consider his stinging comments, Wayne Rooney has conceded he was wrong to claim Virgil van Dijk had "downed tools" after signing a new deal at Liverpool. The row had threatened to boil over as the pair clashed live on TV, but the former England and Manchester United star has moved to cool the disagreement and also offered Van Dijk advice on how to get the champions' faltering season back on track.

--- Full Text ---
Man Utd legend Rooney criticised the Liverpool captain's leadership and form during a difficult run for the Reds, suggesting the Netherlands international’s body language was a "big concern" and that he and Mohamed Salah "haven't really led that team this season" after signing new deals. Van Dijk swiftly hit back, branding the comments "a bit of a lazy criticism". He added "I didn't hear him last year" during Liverpool's march to the title, implying pundits are quick to criticise during downturns in form.
The row escalated when the pair were face-to-face after the Champions League clash between Liverpool and Real Madrid. Van Dijk told Rooney he felt the comments were "over the top" at times, especially the "comment that I signed my new deal and then it was like 'that is it' and I let it slide". Rooney stood by his performance critique on the night, but he has now had a change of heart and further explained his comments, despite the Reds' recent 3-0 defeat by Manchester City.
Rooney, speaking on The Overlap Fan Debate with Sky Bet, said: "My job now is to give my opinions, and I like to think I'm straight and honest with my opinions and how I feel. The one thing where I maybe went a bit too strong is where I said he’s downed tools since he signed his new contract – that's a big thing to say, and maybe I was wrong on that. But from a performance level, from what we’ve seen from Van Dijk, I don’t think he's been at that level this season, and I said I’m sure as captain he’d be speaking to players, taking them out for food, which he said he has done. Clearly if he's felt he’s done that, if he had to do that, there’s something not right.
He added: "As champions, you can’t lose four games in a row. If you lose one game, there’s questions, and if you lose four in a row, there’s something not quite right. I think getting involved too much in the outside noise – that’s our job [as pundits], focus on your game. As a younger player, I’d be looking at Van Dijk and how he reacts to this – how is it going to help them? You have to get on with your game and speak internally."
Rooney added: "I’ve had criticism much worse than what I said about Van Dijk – both on and off the pitch. Of course, people talk and you take someone’s opinion a bit more serious than others but go and do your talking on the pitch. That’s all he needs to do. I’ve praised van Dijk, about his performances and how good he’s been but, if you’re the Premier League champions and you’re the captain of Liverpool, and they aren’t performing as well, (you will come in for some criticism).
"We used to do it with Cristiano Ronaldo, where Ronaldo wouldn’t defend as much, and we would all work a bit harder. But it’s a tough game and you’re playing against a top team; you scream at your players to get back in and help. That’s what I was saying about leadership – you need to understand what game you’re in and the importance of the game."
The Netherlands haven’t secured their spot at the World Cup just yet, despite sitting top of their qualifying group. Van Dijk will lead his country out against Poland and Lithuania in the coming days, where a win will see them book their place at the tournament in the United States, Canada and Mexico next year.

Title       : 'I needed this change' - Ederson opens up on reasons behind Man City exit as goalkeeper reveals previous attempt to leave Pep Guardiola's side before Fenerbahce transfer | Goal.com
Link        : https://www.goal.com/en/lists/ederson-man-city-exit-goalkeeper-previous-leave-pep-guardiola-fenerbahce-transfer/bltd1561a4ab22e1895
Published   : 2025-11-12T18:35:15.267Z

--- Summary ---
Ederson have revealed the reasons behind his Manchester City exit as the goalkeeper insisted that he "needed this change". The Brazilian became one of Pep Guardiola’s most trusted lieutenants and a cornerstone of City’s domestic dominance during his eight-year stay in Manchester. However, he brought his time at the Etihad to an end this summer. His farewell closed a chapter filled with silverware, which included six Premier League titles, five domestic cups, and the crowning glory in City’s first-ever Champions League triumph.

--- Full Text ---
Despite the historic success, Ederson confessed that a sense of stagnation crept in at the Etihad. He admitted that the fire that once burned in him began to wane as he experienced a difficult final season in 2024-25. A series of five injuries left him frustrated and out of rhythm, and the signing of Gianluigi Donnarumma from Paris Saint-Germain for £26 million ($34m) meant that his time with the Cityzens was over. He signed with Fenerbahce and has now explained that the decision was as much about happiness as it was about football.
Since making his debut for Fenerbahce in September, Ederson has embraced the fiery passion of Turkish football. However, reflecting on his transfer from City, he said: "All cycles come to an end, players come and go, but the club always remains. I had eight wonderful years wearing the City shirt and won 18 titles, but I needed this change and a change of scenery. When Fenerbahce came along, I embraced it. I still have the same mentality, I continue doing my off-field work, just like I did at City with my physical trainer. I still have the winning mentality that I had at City and Benfica, and I want to win at Fenerbahce too."
Ederson is already thinking of winning titles with Fenerbahce and added: "Sometimes it's really good to have new challenges in your life, in your career. It brings new energy, many positive things, and something new within you. With this change, I'm breathing football again and feeling the atmosphere of the games in Turkey, which is crazy. I'm very happy with this challenge; the club hasn't won a national title in a long time. I hope I can help bring back that glory and take the club to the top."
While there were other offers, including interest from Italy and Saudi Arabia, Ederson revealed that his choice was influenced by people he trusted. He spoke with Claudio Taffarel, Brazil’s legendary goalkeeping coach and a Galatasaray icon, as well as several Brazilian players who had represented Fenerbahce in the past. Their advice, he said, made the decision easy.
"I had a brief conversation with Taffarel (the national team's goalkeeping coach), even though he played for their rival (Galatasaray)," he said. "Taffarel spoke wonders about the city, culture, and Turkish people. I also spoke with Brazilians who played for Fenerbahçe, who spoke very highly of the club, the city, the culture, and the climate. So that ended up helping even more. I'm really enjoying this new challenge, this new country, this new league, and this new culture."
Ederson also revealed that he had earlier tried to leave City as he was desperate for a change. "In a previous season I had already tried to leave, but it didn't work out," he said. "I think that influenced my performance a bit during the season. I had five injuries and wasn't at my highest possible level. It was a decision I had already made with my family to talk to the club about leaving if we agreed. I needed this change. There's no point in being at a giant, winning club if you're not happy. That would continue to affect me in the same way."
Ederson’s resurgence in Turkey has already reopened doors, as Carlo Ancelotti has called him for international duty for the upcoming friendlies in November against Senegal and Tunisia. With the World Cup drawing closer, Ederson knows every performance counts and he will be fighting for a starting berth with Alisson Becker.
"There's always great anticipation now that the World Cup is so close," he said. "I was left out of the last few call-ups because of injury, so my expectations are high. No player has a guaranteed spot, the only one who does is Ancelotti. The final decision will be his, because there are many very talented players, and I think he'll have a headache choosing the 23 players."
Ederson is once again enjoying his football in Turkey, and his hunger for success burns as fiercely as ever. He will look to make Ancelotti's job as difficult as possible as he is not short of motivation following a fresh start with Fenerbahce.

Good news, if this is you, because the Mega Lucario ex Figure Collection is over $10 cheaper over on TCGPlayer at $38.47 right now. So either way, you're on to a winner here, trainers.
Mega Evolution: Top Chase Cards You Can Pull Right Now
I would love to find an SIR or Illustration Rare in every booster pack, but nothing worth having is easy to get. This is all well and good until you add up just how many booster packs you've bought to pull one, trust me I know!
I usually get sealed product at launch, then just buy the single cards I want if I haven't pulled them already. Here's the top chase cards from the above expansions including where to buy them now and up-to-date pricing information:
- Team Rocket's Mewtwo ex - 231/182
Near Mint: $547.47
Market Price: $514.75
Most Recent Sale: $440 - Mega Lucario ex - 188/132

Published   : Wed, 12 Nov 2025 17:02:00 +0000

--- Summary ---
Counting down the final games on the original Switch.

--- Full Text ---
The Nintendo Switch is going out in a blaze of glory, with some exciting games launching to make way for the console's successor, the Switch 2. Whether they’re exclusively developed for the Switch or ported over from other platforms, these upcoming Switch games will likely wrap up the Switch era while also being compatible with the Switch 2.
In the second half of 2025, we'll hopefully be getting our hands on well-known in-development titles as well as a host of new games announced at the most recent Nintendo Direct. Here are all of the new Switch games we can look forward to this year.
All Upcoming Switch Games With Release Dates
Terrifier: The ARTcade Game (November 21, 2025)
One of the newest horror icons is getting his own arcade game. The Terrifier series has climbed into horror acclaim across three movies, with IGN's review of Terrifier 3 describing it as as "beloved, slaughterhouse-scrappy franchise that nails the art (heh) of the kill." Now, you get the chance to be Art the Clown in a gory, pixel-art beat-em up. If it wasn't clear, this one's definitely not for the kids.
BUBBLE BOBBLE Sugar Dungeons (November 26, 2025)
Definitely a vibe shift here. The newest game in the Bubble Bobble action series lets you use the power of bubbles to traverse dungeons, gather treasure, and level up your abilities. The game offers a two-player co-op mode and also comes with a port of the OG 1997 game Bubble Symphony.
Los Pingheros (December 1, 2025)
The multiplayer brawler is making its way to Switch after releasing on PC earlier this year. Up to eight players can battle it out in a penguin showdown across maps inspired by the vibrant colors of Mexico. Learn secret penguin techniques, customize your penguin, and explore a spread of brawl modes.
Marvel Cosmic Invasion (December 1, 2025)
Marvel Cosmic Invasion was one of the biggest announcements from the 'Switch 1' Nintendo Direct back in May. Now, we finally have a release date. The game will launch with 15 heroes you can choose from to build a beat 'em up tag team. It also features a pretty stacked voice cast, and IGN's early preview describes it as "exactly what 90s kids want it to be."
Octopath Traveler 0 (December 4, 2025)
The "final announcement" from the most recent Nintendo Direct was a new Octopath Traveler game from Square Enix. For the first time in the series, you'll be able to customize your own character, who is tasked with rebuilding the town of Wishvale while also seeking vengeance against its destroyers. Of course, you'll have plenty of party members to recruit for help.
Metroid Prime 4: Beyond (December 4, 2025)
Yes, it’s real. We finally got a release date for Metroid Prime 4. Now available to preorder, the game sees Samus arrive on a planet where she discovers a new slate of psychic powers and a bounty hunter dead set on taking her down. You can learn more about this one in our hands-on preview.
Dunjungle (December 11, 2025)
This side-scrolling 2D roguelite launched in early access back in 2024 and is now make its way to the Nintendo console. Play as a monkey hero, encountering new characters and unlocking new classes in each run across procedurally generated dungeons. No checkpoints here!
Dragon Quest VII Reimagined (February 5, 2026)
Dragon Quest is really going at it with the remakes. It started with HD-2D remakes of the first three games, and now we’re skipping a few installments to go straight to Fragments of the Past. This next ‘revamp’ goes for “Reimagined,” and features a pretty substantial overhaul of the graphics and gameplay from the original JRPG released in 2001.
Upcoming Switch Games With Unknown Release Dates

November's list of PlayStation Plus Game Catalog titles has been confirmed by Sony and, as expected, it includes a welcome return for Grand Theft Auto 5.
Just in case you're one of the few people that doesn't already own Rockstar's open-world epic already, the game is once again part of PlayStation Plus for the month of November. It's a timely addition, too, and almost like publisher Take-Two knew it was about to once again delay Grand Theft Auto 6, which will now launch on November 19, 2026.
A bumper month of other additions also includes enjoyably creepy Scottish oil rig horror game Still Wakes the Deep, made by Everybody's Gone to the Rapture studio The Chinese Room, and the critically-acclaimed first-person automobile-based survival game Pacific Drive.
Also included are brain-teasing first-person puzzler The Talos Principle 2, and delightfully British comedy platformer Thank Goodness You're Here! Both of those are well worth a look. Other titles this month include multiplayer shooter Insurgency: Sandstorm, arcade truck demolisher Monster Jam Showdown, and yet more cars in MotoGP 25.
If you're a PlayStation Plus Premium subscriber, you'll also gain access to the Tomb Raider: Anniversary collection, which emulates the PS2 version of the original Tomb Raider title. Here's the full list of everything available:
PlayStation Plus November 2025 Games:
PlayStation Plus Extra:
- Grand Theft Auto 5 (PS5, PS4)

Battlefield 6 is set to receive what could be its biggest update yet, including reverted aim assist and additional weapon bloom tweaks, as soon as November 18, as work on Season 1 continues.
EA and Battlefield Studios outlined the past, present, and future of its Battlefield 6 and REDSEC post-launch plans in an update posted online today. It comes with a list of headlines for ongoing issues players can expect to see addressed when Season 1’s next chapter, California Resistance, launches November 18, as well as some of the content set to arrive with Winter Offensive come December 9.
“For our teams across Battlefield Studios, this is just the start,” a message from the team says. “We’ve been watching, reading, listening, and we’re hard at work on how we will evolve the experiences for you all. We’re focused, fired up, and getting it done because Battlefield has always been at its best when we build it together, as we have done on our journey through Battlefield Labs, our Open Beta, launch and the current Season 1.”
BF Studios has teased that the Battlefield 6 California Offensive update will bring a new map, called Eastwood, alongside new weapons and a new mode. We now know the mid-season update will also tackle five key elements across the experience: Weapon dispersion/bloom, lighting adjustments, challenge clarity, Fort Lyndon in Portal, and aim assist.
Weapon dispersion and weapon bloom remain one of the hottest topics among Battlefield 6 players online, as they affect each weapon’s accuracy depending on a variety of in-game factors. BF Studios says it’s made a “small tuning pass that reduces how quickly dispersion and recoil build up during sustained fire.” These tweaks apply to all weapons, with most also benefiting from recoil refinements, with the developers hoping players’ weapons “feel smoother and more consistent, especially at longer ranges” going forward.
Lighting and visibility changes target soldier visibility, while challenge requirements, something BF Studios already began tackling in a recent update, should be clearer starting with the November 18 update for Battlefield 6. Portal players can also expect to take advantage of more from Fort Lyndon as they continue building out their ideal Battlefield 6 maps and modes. As promised, aim assist settings will also be reverted to fall more in line with what players experienced during the open beta tests a few months back.
“We’ve adjusted Aim Assist to make aiming feel smoother and more predictable, helping players build stronger muscle memory,” a message from the team says. “Tuning is now similar to the Open Beta experience. As a result, Infantry Aim Assist and Infantry Aim Assist Slowdown have been reset to match the new values, so try the update before making changes.”
Battlefield 6 is set to receive major changes when California Resistance launches November 18, but the December 9 update could also deliver some game-changing adjustments. Vehicle balance tweaks are one thing BF Studios has planned for next month, with fixes for some Breakthrough and Rush maps also on the way.
Finally, while no concrete plans are in the pipeline yet, BF Studios has outlined a number of community talking points that it is looking into for Battlefield 6 and REDSEC. These include additional challenge adjustments, UI and menu improvements, player stats, social play, hit registration/netcode, the overall vehicle experience, and, yes, even map sizes.
“We have seen your comments about map size and pacing. Battlefield is at its best when maps offer different ways to play and constant action around every corner. Striking that balance is always a priority, and we are committed to a variety of map types across future Seasons. With Eastwood arriving in the California Resistance Update, we will continue monitoring existing maps and modes for targeted adjustments (like what’s planned in Winter Offensive) while also learning from community creations in Portal.”
Portal players have famously used the community tools it offers to build not only wacky creations but some of the bigger maps players are looking for, too. IGN recently spoke with creative director Thomas Andersson about the future of Portal, and we learned that BF Studios has more in store when it comes to fleshing out that mode.
“There’s always been the plan to add features and add new content as we go to Portal and make that available for people to create new, impressive experiences,” Andersson said. “The stuff they’ve created so far is just mind-blowing, some of it. It’s like, ‘Oh, how do you guys think of this?’ It’s crazy. It’s been a joy to watch, and I think it will keep getting better and better as they get more comfortable with the tools, as we give them even more things to play with.”
A number of topical REDSEC elements are also under review, including audio performance, a casual battle royale mode, armor plating, and tank availability. Another option BF Studios is looking into revolves around a solo battle royale experience and how such an option could work for Battlefield 6 and its battle royale offshoot.
"We’re just getting started, and there’s more to come," BF Studios' message signs off. "Following the California Resistance Update on November 18, Winter Offensive arrives December 9, with Season 2 launching in early 2026. Thank you for continuing to shape the future of Battlefield with us."
For more on Battlefield 6 and what’s to come with Season 1, you can read more from our interview, including more insight into what solos could look like, as well as the team’s response to the recent REDSEC review-bombing campaign. You can also read about the the 1.1.1.5 update, which launched yesterday.

Title       : Deals for Today: Pokémon TCG for MSRP and Early Black Friday Gaming Deals
Link        : https://www.ign.com/articles/deals-for-today-november-12
Published   : Wed, 12 Nov 2025 17:40:00 +0000

--- Summary ---
Pokémon TCG ex Special Collection boxes are dropping at MSRP ($24.99) on Walmart tomorrow, Nov. 13, with five-hour early access for paid Walmart+ members. Walmart+ is half price until Dec. 2, making this the perfect time to sign up and secure your set. Plus, early Black Friday gaming deals are live across Xbox and PlayStation, with Elite Series 2 controllers $60 off, PS5 Pro consoles discounted, and top titles like Rise of the Ronin and Spider-Man: Miles Morales on sale.

--- Full Text ---
It's not every day I can write about Pokémon TCG sealed product selling at MSRP, but today is the day. Tomorrow, Walmart is launching its Black Friday Pokémon TCG offering with three ex Premium Collection boxes containing 8 boosters for $24.99. The good news is if you're a Walmart+ paying member (Free trials excluded), you'll get in five hours early to make your purchase.
TL;DR: Deals for Today
After some new gubbins for your Xbox Series X|S or PlayStation 5? Black Friday deals are coming in hard and fast on controllers, games and other peripherals, so don't miss out. Let's get straight into todays deals:
Sign Up for Walmart+ For MSRP Pokémon TCG
Want to make sure you get one of these on the day? Well the max buy limit is 5, and Walmart+ is half price until 2nd December, so it's the perfect time to get signed up and make sure you're ready for tommorow, 13th November at 4 pm PT / 7 pm ET (or five hours before for Walmart+ members). One things for sure, 8 booster packs for $24.99 is a great deal in this climate.
Xbox Early Black Friday Deals
These deals are Black Friday level bargains. $60 off an Elite Series 2 Core controller? Bargain. A cheeky 512GB of extra storage for $10 and change off? Believe it. Even if you don't have an Xbox, the Xbox Controller, Fire Stick and Game Pass Ultimate bundles are heavily discounted too.
PlayStation 5 Early Black Friday Deals
You can actually buy a PS5 Pro for around the same price as a standard Xbox Series X right now, let that sink in. Already got a PlayStation 5? Some of the best games on the console are marked down right now. Even newer releases such as Rise of the Ronin is down to $44.70. Don't miss out on these early Black Friday deals.
Electric Scooter Deals Starting at $109
Scooters have some major advantages over bikes. They're lighter, more compact, and usually less expensive. Electric assisted scooters give you more range and speed for less effort, and the brushless motor is pretty quiet. You'd think upgrading to one would cost you a lot of money, but that doesn't have to be the case. AliExpress is offering a couple of well-regarded electric scooters at prices you probably didn't expect.
You can pick up a LADPED LP80 350W electric scooter for just $127 with coupon code "AEUS26". Alternatively, the LADPED LP60 350W electric scooter, which has a smaller battery, is $109.53 after code "AEUS20". Both scooters ship free from a local US warehouse; since they've already been shipped from overseas, any tariffs have already been paid for and you don't need to worry about them. AliExpress marketplace vendor AOVOPRO is an authorized reseller of these scooters and has plenty of reviews and sales to back up its reputation.
60% off Samsung S90D 65" and 77"
144hz refresh rate screams gaming TV to me, especially when it's on a quantum dot OLED screen. That 144hz refresh rate is supported on all four of its HDMI 2.1 ports, which is insane. There's no worries about getting the best performance from your Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch 2 and even gaming PCs.
MSI Vector HX 16" AMD Ryzen 9 8940HX RTX 5070 Ti Gaming Laptop
With a processor that's built for performance and outperforms Intel Core i9-1400HX, we're off to a good start with this RTX 5070Ti gaming laptop. 32GB DDR5 Ram is higher end too, clocked at 6400MHz and has a tidy 1TB M.2 SSD, both of which can be upgraded at anytime. Topping this build with a 240Hz QHD screen and you're laughing at this price point.
Samsung P9 512GB MicroSD Express Card
Whilst this is one of the cheaper options for a Switch 2 Micro SD Express card, there's cheaper. The problem is with cheaper cards is the lower transfer speeds, which add up on more demanding games. Getting a Samsung P9 ensures 800MB/s, with Samsung having a great reputation for storage products in general.
ASRock Steel Legend Radeon RX 9070 XT
Want something that performs around the same as a RTX 5070Ti without the price tag to go with it? AMD is slowly clawing back its GPU market share by targeting mid-range gamers, but the RX 9070 XT is a brilliant graphics card. Whilst I can run something like Oblivion Remastered at 4K 60FPS all day long on it, I get a lot more joy from it playing at 1440P and getting twice the frame rate instead. This is well worth the money if you're in the market for a new GPU.
iBuypower Y40 Pro RTX 5080 Gaming PC
RTX 5080 has claimed it place as the sweet spot on the Nvidia 5000 series GPU lineup. It'll play anything in 4K with dedicated ray tracing support, and has DLSS4 technology to insert AI frames and resolution upgrades to fall back on. Ryzen 9 7900X is also a solid processor to back up the 5080, with a max turbo of 5.6GHz and rocking 12 cores, 24 threads and 64mb of L2 cache. Long story short? It's a cracking rig for under $2,000.
Up To 50% off Pokémon TCG
You might want to check if your AMEX and Discovery is eligible for up to 50% off Pokémon TCG on Amazon right now. All you have to do is add a sealed product to your basket sold directly by Amazon, use your AMEX or Discovery and pay either $1 or use 1 loyalty point to apply the discount. You could also be extra savvy and get a $60 Amazon gift card by being accepted for an Amazon Store Card. Of course, none of this is financial advice, and if you're going to struggle not spending on credit and store cards, make the right choice.
Nice and simple, sign up for a zero commitment Audible Premium Plus sub and get your first 3 months for $0.99 a month. That's 3 months of top tier access for under $3, it's worth doing just to try the service out!
Alienware Aurora R16 RTX 5080 Gaming PCs
Here's two 4K gaming beasts that will stay that way for a long time. If you're just focused on having a RTX 5080 for now with a view to upgrade in the future, go for the $2,099.99 build. If you can stretch the extra $650, you're getting a far better processor, double the DDR5 RAM and double the M.2 SSD space. Either way, you win with a cheeky 14% off.
LG Evo C5 4K TV Bundle Deal
Need a beast of a TV that can handle proper gaming performance and the Thanksgiving football game in style? 77" should do the job, and this is LG's C5 4K 2025 model that's half-price. You'll also save over $300 snagging the S40T Soundbar and Subwoofer combo alongside a slim wall mount. This is one of the best early Black Friday deals.
Samsung S84F 4K OLED Smart TV
At 53% off, this 2025 model Samsung TV is a bargain thanks to its 4K OLED panel with all the bells and whistles you'd come to expect from one of the biggest TV manufacturers.
Nintendo Switch 2 Mario Kart World Console Bundle
Who wants a Nintendo Switch 2 for less than MSRP? Yeah, it's a silly question, right? These consoles are brand new, just from a different region and work exactly the same as a US model. They're region-free and AliExpress has a massive discount code to bring this deal home.

--- Full Text ---
Σε περισσότερα καταστήματα μέσα στην επόμενη χρονιά προγραμματίζει η Levi’s να διαθέσει την premium denim σειρά της προς 300 δολάρια το κάθε προϊόν, καθώς επιδιώκει να ενισχύσει την ανάπτυξη αξιοποιώντας την ισχυρή ζήτηση για denim υψηλής ποιότητας
Η σειρά Blue Tab με τζιν και πουκάμισα υψηλότερης ποιότητας, που κυκλοφόρησε στην Ασία νωρίτερα φέτος και σε περίπου 24 καταστήματα στην Ευρώπη και τις ΗΠΑ από τον Σεπτέμβριο, αποτελεί μέρος μιας συνεχιζόμενης προσπάθειας για τη διεύρυνση της μάρκας Levi’s και την προσέλκυση περισσότερων γυναικών.
«Επιστρέφουμε σε μεγαλύτερη κλίμακα το 2026, αφού είχαμε μια πολύ καλή πορεία νωρίτερα», δήλωσε στο Reuters ο οικονομικός διευθυντής και διευθυντής ανάπτυξης Harmit Singh.
Το premium denim αντιπροσωπεύει περίπου το 10% της παγκόσμιας αγοράς denim, αξίας περίπου 100 δισ. δολαρίων
Στην Ευρώπη, τα τζιν Blue Tab πωλούνται σε τιμές μεταξύ 250 και 350 ευρώ (290-410 δολάρια), σε σύγκριση με 70 και 130 ευρώ για τη σειρά Red Tab, ενώ τα μπουφάν Blue Tab πωλούνται σε τιμές περίπου 700 ευρώ.
Η Levi’s, η οποία επί του παρόντος πωλεί κυρίως τζιν μεσαίας κατηγορίας στη σειρά Red Tab, καθώς και μια σειρά μαζικής αγοράς για καταστήματα outlet και Walmart, αντιμετωπίζει μια λεπτή ισορροπία όσον αφορά την εξυπηρέτηση τόσο των αγορών του προϋπολογισμού όσο και των premium.
Ενώ το premium denim αντιπροσωπεύει περίπου το 10% της παγκόσμιας αγοράς denim, αξίας περίπου 100 δισεκατομμυρίων δολαρίων, αναπτύσσεται ταχύτερα από το μεσαίου μεγέθους μονοψήφιο ποσοστό της κατηγορίας των κανονικών τζιν, εξήγησε ο Singh.
«Η τιμή είναι ένας σημαντικός παράγοντας για τους πελάτες, ωστόσο η ποιότητα του προϊόντος παίζει όλο και περισσότερη σημασία. Έτσι, η νέα μας σειρά αντλεί έμπνευση από το ιαπωνικό τζιν, την ούγια», είπε ο Singh σε μια συνέντευξη στο εκθεσιακό χώρο του ομίλου στο Παρίσι.
Το τζιν υφαίνεται σε παραδοσιακούς αργαλειούς που παράγουν αυτοτελικά φινιρισμένες άκρες και ένα σφιχτά υφασμένο, πυκνότερο ύφασμα. «Ενώ ο σχεδιασμός είναι επίσης το κλειδί, με μια ισχυρότερη σειρά προϊόντων να έχει προγραμματιστεί για το επόμενο έτος σε όλες τις σειρές ανδρών και γυναικών», πρόσθεσε.
Ο κατασκευαστής των εμβληματικών 501, ο οποίος ανακοίνωσε πωλήσεις 6,4 δισεκατομμυρίων δολαρίων πέρυσι, είχε θέσει ως στόχο την επίτευξη εσόδων 10 δισεκατομμυρίων δολαρίων και περιθωρίου λειτουργικών κερδών 15% έως το 2027, αλλά ακύρωσε το χρονοδιάγραμμα κατά τη διάρκεια της πανδημίας, καθώς ο υψηλός πληθωρισμός επιβράδυνε την ανάπτυξη.
Οι εμπορικοί δασμοί του Ντόναλντ Τραμπ, από την άλλη, έχουν προσθέσει περαιτέρω αντιξοότητες στην εταιρεία, αλλά μετά από υψηλή μονοψήφια αύξηση εσόδων τα τελευταία τρίμηνα, ο Singh διευκρίνισε ότι η εταιρεία μπορεί να είναι έτοιμη να σκιαγραφήσει ένα νέο χρονοδιάγραμμα το επόμενο έτος.
Ο σχεδιασμός της Levi’s προβλέπει ακόμη μια εξαγορά ενός brand
Παρ’ όλα αυτά, η Levi’s αναμένει μια δυνατή εορταστική περίοδο με την εταιρεία να πουλάει αυτή τη στιγμή περισσότερα προϊόντα σε πλήρη τιμή φέτος σε σύγκριση με ένα χρόνο πριν.
«Ο καταναλωτής έχει σε μεγάλο βαθμό επιδείξει ανθεκτικότητα. Και δεν βλέπουμε καμία συρρίκνωση της ζήτησης», ανέφερε, προσθέτοντας ότι η Levi’s θα περιορίσει τις εκπτώσεις όσο το δυνατόν περισσότερο.
Η επέκταση σε υφάσματα εκτός τζιν που προσελκύουν νέους πελάτες και οι συνεργασίες με μάρκες όπως η Barbour και η Nike συμβάλλουν στην πώληση σε πλήρεις τιμές, επισήμανε ο Singh, ενώ η χαμηλότερη τιμή του βαμβακιού φέτος βοήθησε στη διατήρηση του χαμηλού κόστους.
«Αργότερα, η Levi’s θα μπορούσε να αγοράσει μια νέα μάρκα για να επιταχύνει την ανάπτυξη», τόνισε χαρακτηριστικά ο Singh, αναφερόμενος στην επιχείρηση Beyond Yoga αξίας 150 εκατομμυρίων δολαρίων, την οποία απέκτησε το 2021.
«Έτσι αυτή τη στιγμή, διαθέτουμε δύο μάρκες, αλλά έχουμε αφήσει ανοιχτή την πόρτα για ακόμη ένα brand», συμπλήρωσε. «Οτιδήποτε θα μπορούσε να επιταχύνει την πορεία της επιχείρησης, είναι κάτι που θα εξετάζαμε – όχι όμως ακόμη».

--- Full Text ---
Η ηγέτιδα και κληρονόμος της γαλλικής ακροδεξιάς Μαρίν Λεπέν δήλωσε ότι δεν πρόκειται να υποβάλει εκ νέου υποψηφιότητα για την προεδρία της Γαλλίας το 2027, εάν το εφετείο της υπόθεσης με την οποία έχασε το δικαίωμα του εκλέγεσθαι, δεν ανατρέψει την πρωτόδικη απόφαση.
Η Λεπέν, έχει μέχρι στιγμής θέσει τρεις φορές υποψηφιότητα για την προεδρία με τον Εθνικό Συναγερμό – RN και αναμένει το εφετείο στις 13 Ιανουαρίου κατά της πρωτόδικης καταδικαστικής απόφασης για την κατηγορία της υπεξαίρεσης κονδυλίων από το Ευρωπαϊκό Κοινοβούλιο, για την οποία έχασε το δικαίωμα συμμετοχής στις γαλλικές εκλογές.
Το δικαστήριο μετά την καταδικαστική κρίση της επέβαλε ποινή πενταετή αποκλεισμού από την υποψηφιότητα για κάθε δημόσιο αξίωμα, μια απόφαση η οποία μπορεί να ανατραπεί μονάχα στο εφετείο. Η ίδια αρνείται την ενοχή της στην υπόθεση.
Το διακύβευμα από την Γαλλία στα χέρια της ακροδεξιάς, θεωρείται ύψιστης σημασίας για την Ευρώπη.
«Δεδομένου ότι το εφετείο πιθανότατα θα εκδώσει την απόφασή του τον Σεπτέμβριο, δεν θα αφήσω την υπόθεση να σέρνεται», δήλωσε η ηγέτιδα της ακροδεξιάς στο RTL.
Η Λε Πεν συμπλήρωσε σε ό,τι αφορά τον προστατευόμενό της Ζορντάν Μπαρντελά: «Ο Ζορντάν έχει τα προσόντα να αναλάβει οποιαδήποτε θέση». Ο Μπαρντελά συμπλήρωσε «πέτυχε πραγματικά θεαματικά αποτελέσματα ως επικεφαλής υποψήφιος στις ευρωπαϊκές εκλογές». «Νομίζω ότι ο Ζορντάν έχει τα προσόντα να αναλάβει οποιαδήποτε θέση που απαιτεί θέληση, πεποίθηση και αχαλίνωτη αγάπη για τη χώρα», πρόσθεσε.
Σχολιάζοντας την θέση στην οποία βρίσκεται η ίδια, δηλαδή την πρώτη φορά στην οποία η γαλλική ακροδεξιά έχει πιθανότητες να εκλέξει πρόεδρο της Γαλλίας, με την ίδια να παραχωρεί την θέση της, είπε ότι «προφανώς, είναι μια πολύ δύσκολη απόφαση, αλλά απαραίτητη για το συμφέρον της χώρας».
Η ίδια τόνισε πως «θέλει να καθαρίσει το όνομά της», λέγοντας ότι «προφανώς θα προσφύγω στο Ακυρωτικό Δικαστήριο, γιατί θα υπερασπιστώ τα δικαιώματά μου και την αθωότητά μου μέχρι τέλους. Ωστόσο, δεδομένου ότι το Εφετείο θα εκδώσει πιθανώς την απόφασή του τον Σεπτέμβριο, δεν θα αφήσω τα πράγματα να τραβήξουν σε μάκρος, γιατί είμαι αποφασισμένη να δω τις ιδέες μας να υλοποιούνται».
«Αν μου απαγορευτεί να υποβάλω υποψηφιότητα, αλλά το Ακυρωτικό Δικαστήριο αποφανθεί υπέρ μου τρεις ή τέσσερις μήνες αργότερα, θα είναι πολύ αργά για να διεξάγω μια κανονική προεκλογική εκστρατεία» δήλωσε η Λεπέν.
Σχολιάζοντας το επιχείρημα των αντιπάλων του RN, που θεωρούν ότι ο πιθανός διάδοχος του πολιτικού της κόμματος είναι πολύ άπειρος για να αναλάβει την προεδρία της Γαλλίας σε ηλικία 31 ετών, η Μαρίν Λεπέν απάντησε ότι «η ιστορία της Γαλλίας είναι γεμάτη από ανθρώπους που, σε πολύ νεαρή ηλικία, κατάφεραν να αλλάξουν την πορεία της», με την αναφορά της να φωτογραφίζει τον Μέγα Ναπολέοντα, ο οποίος έγινε Πρόεδρος της Γαλλικής Δημοκρατίας σε ηλικία 33 ετών.
Δημοσκόπηση που δημοσιεύθηκε νωρίτερα αυτόν τον μήνα έδειξε ότι τόσο η Λε Πεν όσο και ο Μπαρντελά έχουν διψήφιο προβάδισμα έναντι των αντιπάλων τους στην πρόθεση ψήφου στον πρώτο γύρο, με το RN να προηγείται με 34% έναντι του δεύτερου Λαϊκού Μετώπου που συγκεντρώνει το 24% (δημοσκόπηση 8ης Οκτωβρίου 2025).
Σύμφωνα με τα αποτελέσματα δημοσκόπησης ως προς τους αρχηγούς, ο Ζορντάν Μπαρντελά θα εξασφάλιζε περίπου 35 έως 37,5% των ψήφων αν ο πρώτος γύρος διεξαγόταν τον Νοέμβριο που διεξήχθη η δημοσκόπηση, ενώ η Μαρίν Λεπέν θα λάμβανε περίπου 34%.

--- Full Text ---
Στα Βίλια επικεντρώνονται οι έρευνες της Αστυνομίας για την εξιχνίαση της άγριας δολοφονίας του 27χρονου οικοδόμου που τον δολοφόνησαν με μια σφαίρα και στη συνέχεια έκαψαν τη σορό του μέσα σε κλεμμένο αυτοκίνητο.
Μέσα από βιντεοληπτικό υλικό από κάμερες ασφαλείας αλλά και από μαρτυρίες, οι Αρχές προσπαθούν να εντοπίσουν τί συνέβη εκείνη την ημέρα και ποιος άρπαξε τον 27χρονο από το σημείο όπου βρέθηκε το δικό του αυτοκίνητο στα Βίλια.
Σύμφωνα με το ρεπορτάζ του Βασίλη Λαμπρόπουλο στο Live News από τα μέχρι τώρα στοιχεία που έχει η ΕΛ.ΑΣ. δεν φαίνεται να εμπλέκεται ο 27χρονος με οργανωμένα κυκλώματα ναρκωτικών ή όπλων ενώ αποκλείεται και η εμπλοκή του σε δολοφονία ενός ποινικού πριν από μερικές ημέρες κοντά στην Αράχωβα.
Ένα ακραίο σενάριο που εξετάζεται είναι ο 27χρονος να έπεσε θύμα συνωνυμίας με έναν σκληρό κακοποιό από την Αλβανία οποίος εμπλέκεται σε πολλές δολοφονίες.
Ωστόσο σύμφωνα με τον δικηγόρο της οικογένειάς του, Αλέξανδρο Παπαϊωαννίδη, το ενδεχόμενο να σκότωσαν τον 27χρονο κατά λάθος επειδή είχε το ίδιο όνομα τον συγκεκριμένο ποινικό, δεν φαίνεται να ευσταθεί.
Η διαδρομή που φέρεται να ακολούθησε βρίσκεται στο μικροσκόπιο των Αρχών, όπως και οι απειλές που ενδεχομένως να δέχτηκε.
«Έφυγε από το σπίτι του 4 Νοεμβρίου, πήγε στα Βίλια, στα Βίλια πήρε τηλέφωνο τη γυναίκα του, της είπε ότι περιμένει το ραντεβού του, μετά το τηλέφωνό του έκλεισε. Την Παρασκευή ένας κυνηγός εντόπισε ένα καμένο αυτοκίνητο, μέσα στο αυτοκίνητο ήταν ο 27χρονος, ειδοποιήθηκε η αστυνομία και έκτοτε έγινε η ταυτοποίηση. Βρέθηκε στο πίσω μέρος του αυτοκινήτου, υπάρχει μία σφαίρα και το αυτοκίνητο προφανώς κάηκε για να καούν τα ίχνη», είπε στο Live News ο Γεράσιμος Κουρούκλης, Διοικητής Υπηρεσίας Silver Alert.
Οι υποθέσεις οργανωμένου εγκλήματος καταλήγουν κάπως έτσι, με ένα καμένο αυτοκίνητο. Μάλιστα το συγκεκριμένο αυτοκίνητο το είχαν κλέψει πριν από 1 χρόνο στην Γλυφάδα.
Οι συγγενείς του 27χρονου θρηνούν και ζητούν απαντήσεις.
«Είμαστε χάλια. Δεν μπορώ να καταλάβω, δεν μπορώ να καταλάβω ούτε και εγώ σαν θείος. Ο ανιψιός μου δεν μιλούσε με τίποτα. Την Τρίτη το απόγευμα έφυγε. Άμα ήξερα που θα πήγαινε, θα είχα πάει και εγώ πίσω του. Δεν το ήξερα, ούτε εγώ. Έχει δύο παιδιά, μικρά, ενός μήνα είναι το παιδί του. Θέλει βοήθεια (η γυναίκα του) που θα βρούμε τη βοήθεια εμείς; Και τα παιδιά του. Μένουνε τώρα στον δρόμο, άστα να πάνε τώρα. Δεν είχανε πρόβλημα, ρώτησα και την κοπέλα εγώ, μου λέει δεν είχαν θέμα, τίποτα λέει. Όπως τον γνωρίζω εγώ, σαν ανιψιό μου ήταν δουλειά, σπίτι, δουλειά, σπίτι, τώρα δεν ξέρω», λέει ο θείος του.
Τι υποστήριξε η σύζυγος του 27χρονου απανθρακωμένου Ο άντρας έφυγε από το σπίτι του με κατεύθυνση τα Βίλια Αττικής. Επικοινώνησε με τη σύζυγό του, την ενημέρωσε ότι έχει φτάσει στα Βίλια και περιμένει έναν φίλο του. Το φιλικό του περιβάλλον λέει ότι θα συναντούσε μία κυρία, την οποία είχε γνωρίσει το τελευταίο διάστημα μέσω TikTok.
Το όχημά του εντοπίστηκε παρκαρισμένο στην είσοδο γηπέδου μπάσκετ στα Βίλια Αττικής ενώ εντός του οχήματος βρέθηκαν μόνο τα τσιγάρα του και μία ζακέτα.
Παράλληλα, σύμφωνα με τις πληροφορίες, η σύζυγος του 27χρονου κατά τη κατάθεσή της στις Αρχές ρωτήθηκε για ο γυναικείο προφίλ στο TikTok ενώ υπέδειξε και τα πρόσωπα που έρχονταν σε επαφή το τελευταίο διάστημα με τον σύζυγό της.
Ταυτόχρονα, αποκάλυψε πως ο σύζυγός της είχε δεχτεί απειλητικά μηνύματα πριν από 3 χρόνια από τον πρώην σύντροφό της, ο οποίος, όπως λέει, ήταν ζηλιάρης όμως δεν είχαν πιαστεί ποτέ στα χέρια. Η ίδια παρέδωσε και τα δύο δικά της κινητά.
«Του δώσανε στίγμα και πήγε με GPS εκεί πέρα» Ο θείος του προσθέτει στο Live News:
-Έχει βρεθεί το DNA είναι το δικό του. Δεν μας πηγαίνει καθόλου το μυαλό, δεν μας πηγαίνει πουθενά, ήταν δουλευταράς, ήταν εργατικός, δεν ξέρουμε αν είχε μπλέξει, αν είχε… Δεν ξέρουμε τίποτα. Έχουμε μείνει κόκαλο όλοι.
-Δεχόταν απειλές από κάποιον;
-Όχι, όχι, όχι από κανέναν. Δεν μας είχε πει τίποτα και σίγουρα θα μας έλεγε. Δεν είχε απασχολήσει τις Aρχές, ούτε μας είχε δώσει τέτοια δικαιώματα.
-Πήγαινε προς τα Βίλια. Ούτε ο ίδιος δεν ήξερε εκεί πέρα το μέρος, με GPS πήγε. Του δώσανε στίγμα και πήγε με GPS εκεί πέρα. Πήγε εκεί και δεν γύρισε, θα γυρνούσε μετά από καμιά ώρα και δεν γύρισε. Κάποιον πήγε να βρει εκεί πέρα.
Η οικογένειά του παραμένει συγκλονισμένη και ζητά να βρεθούν ποιοι κρύβονται πίσω από το αποτρόπαιο έγκλημα που άφησε έναν άνθρωπο νεκρό και μια οικογένεια διαλυμένη.

Το σκάνδαλο ΟΠΕΚΕΠΕ, που όπως όλα δείχνουν το Μαξίμου γνώριζε αλλά δεν έκανε τίποτα μέχρι που παρενέβη η ευρωπαία εισαγγελέας, εξακολουθεί να προκαλεί αλυσιδωτές αντιδράσεις.

Σε κρίσιμο σταυροδρόμι βρίσκονται οι αγροτικές επιδοτήσεις, με ευθύνη της κυβέρνησης. Στη σκιά του σκανδάλου του ΟΠΕΚΕΠΕ το Μαξίμου έσκαψε σκάνδαλα και σήμερα θερίζει θύελλες.
Το «επιτελικό κράτος» που οραματίστηκε ο Κυριάκος Μητσοτάκης έπεσε σε ξέρα και χρειάστηκε η παρέμβαση της ευρωπαϊκής εισαγγελίας για να αλλάξει γραμμή πλεύσης όμως η ζημιά είχε γίνει και αποδείχθηκε μεγάλη.
Περίοδο έντονης αβεβαιότητας βιώνουν οι αγρότες και οι κτηνοτρόφοι της χώρας
Για να αποφευχθεί στο μέλλον να πέσει ξανά στα βράχια η ελληνική κυβέρνηση κατέθεσε νέο σχέδιο δράσης στην Κομισιόν οδηγώντας όμως τους παραγωγούς σε ένδεια. Τώρα, οι Βρυξέλλες καλούνται να περάσουν από κόσκινο το action plan 2 που καταρτίστηκε.
«Δεν θέλουμε να τιμωρήσουμε την Ελλάδα, θέλουμε τα χρήματα να φτάνουν στους αγρότες που τα δικαιούνται», τόνισαν πηγές από την Κομισιόν σε μια άτυπη ενημέρωση αξιωματούχων της Ευρωπαϊκής Επιτροπής για θέματα που σχετίζονται με την αγροτική πολιτική.
Εξήγησαν πως «η καθυστέρηση στην καταβολή των χρημάτων οφείλεται σε μια διαδικασία που ουσιαστικά η χώρα μας πρέπει να καταβάλει τα χρήματα και στη συνέχεια να γίνει η αποζημίωση».
Οι ίδιες πηγές, έχοντας αντιληφθεί πλήρως τι έχει συμβεί, προσέθεσαν ότι υπάρχει μία διαδικασία που αφορά στην κατανομή των ποσών και των απαραίτητων ελέγχων.
Με τη ζημιά για τον πρωτογενή τομέα παραγωγής να έχει γίνει η Ευρωπαϊκή Επιτροπή θα βάλει πλάτη ανοίγοντας το δρόμο για να δουν το χρώμα του χρήματος αγρότες και κτηνοτρόφοι, αν όλα πάνε καλά με το επικαιροποιημένο σχέδιο δράσης που αφορά το ζήτημα ροής των πληρωμών, πριν τα Χριστούγεννα.
Θα ακολουθήσει το δεύτερο σκέλος που αφορά αφορά την ενσωμάτωση του ΟΠΕΚΕΠΕ στην ΑΑΔΕ.
Υπενθυμίζεται ότι στο σχέδιο δράσης για τον ΟΠΕΚΕΠΕ προβλέπονται, μεταξύ άλλων, δημιουργία νέου ψηφιακού γεωχωρικού χάρτη της χώρας για διαχωρισμό επιλέξιμων και μη εκτάσεων, νέος τρόπος καταγραφής των αιγοπροβάτων με ηλεκτρονικό «βώλο», περισσότεροι και πιο στοχευμένοι έλεγχοι από μικτά κλιμάκια, καθώς και εργαλεία για τη διαπίστωση της ιδιοκτησίας των αγροτεμαχίων μέσω διασταυρωτικών ελέγχων με το Εθνικό Κτηματολόγιο και άλλες ψηφιακές βάσεις.
Έχοντας τα παραπάνω δεδομένα, μέχρι τέλος του Νοεμβρίου θα καταβληθεί η προκαταβολή της βασικής ενίσχυσης, καθώς και το Μέτρο 23, συνολικού ύψους περίπου 550-600 εκατομμυρίων ευρώ, διαβεβαίωσε ο υπουργός Αγροτικής Ανάπτυξης και Τροφίμων, Κώστας Τσιάρας.
«Για πρώτη φορά αξιοποιούμε ευρωπαϊκούς πόρους για να στηρίξουμε τον πρωτογενή τομέα», ανέφερε (Real FM και το Action 24) ο υπουργός.
Ανάλογες διαβεβαιώσεις στους εκπροσώπους της Εθνικής Ένωσης Αγροτικών Συνεταιρισμών (ΕΘΕΑΣ) έδωσε ο αντιπρόεδρος της κυβέρνησης Κωστής Χατζηδάκης ενώ παρέλαβε το υπόμνημα με τα αιτήματά τους.
Σε σχέση με την καταβολή των αγροτικών ενισχύσεων, ο αντιπρόεδρος της κυβέρνησης υπογράμμισε: «Είμαστε ανάμεσα σε δύο διαφορετικές πιέσεις. Την πίεση, από τη μια πλευρά, της Ευρωπαϊκής Επιτροπής, που θέλει ευλόγως ένα καινούργιο, αξιόπιστο σύστημα – και τις ευθύνες που μας αναλογούν τις έχουμε αναλάβει δημόσια. Είμαστε υποχρεωμένοι να διασφαλίσουμε, λοιπόν, το ταχύτερο δυνατό ένα καινούργιο, αξιόπιστο σύστημα. Και από την άλλη πλευρά, έχουμε τις, επίσης εύλογες, πιέσεις των αγροτών μας για όσο δυνατόν πιο έγκαιρες πληρωμές».
Ο κ. Χατζηδάκης τόνισε, στη συνέχεια, πως προτεραιότητα της κυβέρνησης είναι η καταβολή της βασικής ενίσχυσης και η πληρωμή εκκρεμών προγραμμάτων: «Είμαστε τώρα στην τελική ευθεία, αφού κάναμε κάποιες επιμέρους πληρωμές, να προχωρήσουμε στη βασική ενίσχυση. Και στη συνέχεια, στην καταβολή των ποσών που πρέπει να καταβληθούν από εκκρεμή προγράμματα, το Μέτρο 23 για παράδειγμα, και μια σειρά από άλλες τέτοιες δράσεις».
Παρά τις κυβερνητικές διαβεβαιώσεις, οι παραγωγοί φοβούνται νέες καθυστερήσεις στις πληρωμές ενώ απέχουμε ένα 24ωρο από τη μαζική κινητοποίηση στο κέντρο των Αθηνών και τον πρόεδρο της ΕΘΕΑΣ να δηλώνει πως «η κυβέρνηση έχει βάλει το αγροτικό ζήτημα στον αυτόματο πιλότο και δεν ξέρουμε και τον προορισμό».

--- Full Text ---
Την Τρίτη 11 Νοεμβρίου, μια τυπική μέρα στην καρδιά της σχολικής χρονιάς, δύο ανήλικοι μεταφέρθηκαν τραυματισμένοι από τα σχολεία τους στο νοσοκομείο Παίδων Αγλαϊα Κυριακού. Το ένα, ένα αγόρι 15,5 ετών έπεσε θύμα άγριου ξυλοδαρμού στο προαύλιο του σχολείου που φοιτά στον Αλιμο, από δύο εξωσχολικά άτομα. Ο έφηβος μεταφέρθηκε στο νοσοκομείο με όχημα του ΕΚΑΒ και συνοδεία της αστυνομίας.
Το δεύτερο αγόρι 12,5 ετών, προσήλθε με τον καθηγητή και τη μητέρα του τραυματισμένο από άλλους μαθητές σε συμπλοκή που συνέβη σε σχολείο του Ζωγράφου.
Τα στοιχεία που συγκέντρωσε ο πρόεδρος της ΠΟΕΔΗΝ, Μιχάλης Γιαννάκος, από όλα τα νοσοκομεία της χώρας, καταδεικνύουν πως η βία ανάμεσα σε ανήλικους παρουσιάζει ανησυχητική αύξηση.
Πάντα σύμφωνα με τα στοιχεία του κ. Γιαννάκου, μόνο στα δύο παιδιατρικά νοσοκομεία της Αττικής, Παίδων Αγία Σοφία και Παίδων Αγλαΐα Κυριακού, διακομίζονται τραυματισμένοι 800 με 850 ανήλικοι τον χρόνο.
Οι έφηβοι έχουν τραυματιστεί σε συμπλοκές που έχουν σημειωθεί είτε μέσα στα σχολεία, είτε σε  πλατείες, στον δρόμο κ.α.
Οσον αφορά πιο συγκεκριμένα τους τραυματισμούς από συμπλοκές μέσα στα σχολεία, κάθε χρόνο προσέρχονται στα δύο Παίδων νοσοκομεία 200 ανήλικοι.
Συνολικά, πάνω από 2.000 ανήλικοι τον χρόνο προσέρχονται  στα νοσοκομεία όλης της χώρας τραυματισμένοι από συμπλοκές. Τα 400 περίπου περιστατικά προέρχονται μέσα από τα σχολεία.
Η περιφέρεια είναι καθρέφτης που αντικατοπτρίζει την κλιμακούμενη βία ανάμεσα στους ανήλικους.
«Χθες προσήλθε στο Καραμανδάνειο ένας έφηβος 14 ετών από την Αμαλιάδα. Τον είχαν χτυπήσει στο κεφάλι και στον αυχένα επειδή έβαλε ένα γκολ σε αγώνα που έγινε στο πλαίσιο σχολικής εκδρομής» περιγράφει στο in ο διευθυντής παιδοχειρουργός στο εν λόγω νοσοκομείο, Βασίλης Αλεξόπουλος.
Σήμερα είδε το φως της δημοσιότητας και μία καταγγελία για άγριο ξυλοδαρμό ενός 15χρονου μαθητή στην Ξάνθη , την παραμονή της 28ης Οκτωβρίου από ομάδα ανηλίκων στο κέντρο της πόλης.
Από την καθημερινή εμπειρία του στο μικρό νοσοκομείο της Πάτρας ο κ. Αλεξόπουλος κάνει λόγο για σημαντική αύξηση των περιστατικών. Σύμφωνα με τα στοιχεία της ΠΟΕΔΗΝ, κάθε χρόνο προσέρχονται στο Καραμανδάνειο, 150 τραυματισμένοι σε συμπλοκές ανήλικοι.
«Τα περιστατικά βίας και η παραβατικότητα ανηλίκων δεν λαμβάνουν χώρα μόνο μέσα στα σχολεία, αλλά και στον δρόμο, έξω από τα φροντιστήρια κ.α. Βλέπουμε να αυξάνεται η χρήση επικίνδυνων μεταλλικών αντικειμένων, σιδηρογροθιές και μαχαίρια» περιγράφει ο κ. Αλεξόπουλος.
Και συνεχίζει: «Οι ανήλικοι έρχονται στο νοσοκομείο με κακώσεις στο κεφάλι, στο πρόσωπο, στον θώρακα, τα χέρια, τα πόδια. Η πλειοψηφία είναι αγόρια αλλά αυξάνονται σταδιακά και τα περιστατικά με κορίτσια».
Επιχειρώντας να ψηλαφήσει τα αίτια του προβλήματος, ο κ. Αλεξόπουλος στρέφει το βλέμμα στην οικογένεια, η οποία: «διαβρώνεται. Τα παιδιά είναι ανορίοτα, η ατιμωρησία “βασιλεύει”. Η αντίληψη για τη σημερινή ανατροφή των παιδιών ενέχει αρκετά προβληματικά σημεία».
Ο κ. Αλεξόπουλος υπογραμμίζει την παράλληλη απουσία του εποπτικού και φροντιστικού ρόλου της Πολιτείας, ειδικά στην περιφέρεια.
«Στην Αχαϊα όπου βρισκόμαστε εμείς, καταγράφεται πλήθος περιστατικών από όλες τις κατηγορίες βίας. Ας δούμε μόνο τις δύο μητέρες που κατηγορούνται ότι αφαίρεσαν τη ζωή από τα παιδιά τους. Στην περιοχή μας, πρωταγωνιστούμε πολύ αρνητικά στο θέμα της προστασίας των παιδιών. Στην περιφέρεια η ματιά της Πολιτείας είναι απούσα» σχολιάζει ο κ. Αλεξόπουλος.
Το αποτέλεσμα είναι σύμφωνα με τον ίδιο, η ανεπάρκεια του συστήματος να «συναντά» με εκρηκτικό τρόπο την ατιμωρησία στις επιθετικές συμπεριφορές των ανήλικων.
Σε κάθε περίπτωση,το θέμα δεν σχετίζεται την ταξική προέλευση. «Τα παιδιά προέρχονται από τις πιο υποβαθμισμένες περιοχές ως τις πιο ευκατάστατες».
Σύμφωνα με τον κ. Αλεξόπουλο, υπάρχει και ένα άγνωστος αριθμός περιστατικών βίας ανάμεσα σε ανήλικους τα οποία δεν καταγράφονται.
«Αυτό συμβαίνει γιατί οι γονείς δεν επιθυμούν την εμπλοκή της αστυνομίας» λέει ο κ. Αλεξόπουλος προσθέτοντας πως: «Τα πιο πολλά από τα παιδιά που προσέρχονται  στο νοσοκομείο είναι θύματα. Εχουν υποστεί bullying. Συνήθως στα νοσοκομεία βλέπουμε τα θύματα όχι τους θύτες. Οι γονείς αυτών των εφήβων θέλουν να κάνουν μήνυση για αυτό που συνέβη στο παιδί τους».
Ο Δημοσθένης Κωνσταντόπουλος, πρόεδρος εργαζομένων στο Παίδων Αγία Σοφία, αναφέρει με τη σειρά του πως υπάρχουν γονείς τραυματισμένων παιδιών τα οποία έχουν εμπλακεί σε πρόκληση τραυματισμού άλλου ανήλικου, οι οποίοι δηλώνουν πως τα παιδιά έπεσαν και χτύπησαν έτσι ώστε να μην κάνει την εμφάνιση της η αστυνομία. «Αν δεν προσέλθει το περιστατικό συνοδευόμενο από την αστυνομία, τη δήλωση για το πώς προκλήθηκε ο τραυματισμός και τι συνέβη, την κάνουν οι γονείς».
Για να αναβαθμιστεί το υποτυπώδες και χαλαρό πλαίσιο καταγραφής των περιστατικών βίας ανάμεσα σε ανηλίκους, πριν από λίγους μήνες, ο υπουργός Δικαιοσύνης, Γιώργος Φλωρίδης, δημιούργησε μια επιτροπή για την αντιμετώπιση της παιδικής κακοποίησης. Πρόεδρος της εν λόγω επιτροπής είναι ο προϊστάμενος της Ιατροδικαστικής υπηρεσίας Αθηνών Νίκος Καρακούκης, ενώ ανάμεσα στα μέλη συμπεριλαμβάνονται ο κ. Αλεξόπουλος και ο διευθυντής της ΜΕΘ Παίδων του νοσοκομείου του Ρίου, Ανδρέας Ηλιάδης.
Ανάμεσα στους στόχους της επιτροπής είναι να δημιουργηθεί ένα πρωτόκολλο αντιμετώπισης των τραυματισμών από περιστατικά βίας τα οποία καταλήγουν στα νοσοκομεία.
Οι εκπαιδευτικοί οι οποίοι είναι συχνά μάρτυρες αυτών των περιστατικών, περιγράφουν την κατάσταση με μελανά χρώματα.
«Κάνουμε την προσευχή μας για να μην έχουμε θύμα. Είναι πια θέμα τύχης» λέει στο in ο Νεκτάριος Κορδής, μέλος Δ.Σ της ΟΛΜΕ.
Οπως προσθέτει: «Η κατάσταση είναι τραγική. Εξωσχολικοί μπαίνουν στα σχολεία ενώ και μαθητές χειροδικούν μεταξύ τους».
Κατά τον κ. Κορδή, το νήμα του προβλήματος εντοπίζεται στην πανδημία και την αποσχολειοποίηση των παιδιών που επέφερε.
Περιγράφοντας από τη δική του θέση τα χαρακτηριστικά αυτής της βίας, ο κ. Κορδής λέει τα εξής: «είναι λυπηρό πως οι ανήλικοι που ασκούν το bullying, ηρωποιούνται από τα άλλα παιδιά. Η βία μεταξύ των εφήβων φιλτράρεται μέσα από τα likes των συνομήλικων. Οι έφηβοι λειτουργούν μιμητικά. Και είναι εξίσου λυπηρό πως σύμφωνα με την εμπειρία μας και τα περιστατικά που λαμβάνουμε στην ΟΛΜΕ από όλη την Ελλάδα, παρατηρείται έξαρση των περιστατικών στις τάξεις του Γυμνασίου. Η βία «κατεβαίνει» ηλικιακά».
Ισως ένας από τους λόγους που συμβαίνει αυτό είναι το γεγονός πως οι έφηβοι: «σε αρκετές περιπτώσεις, μεγαλώνουν με τους γονείς τους απόντες, εκτός οικογένειας για ώρες για να αντιμετωπίσουν τις σημερινές δύσκολες συνθήκες διαβίωσης. Δεν είναι λίγα τα παιδιά που επί της ουσίας μεγαλώνουν παρέα με ένα τάμπλετ».
Οι εκπαιδευτικοί υπογραμμίζουν πως υπουργείο Παιδείας δεν σκύβει σοβαρά πάνω από το πρόβλημα. «Μια φορά έχουμε συναντήσει μόνο οι εκπαιδευτικοί την υπουργό Παιδείας. Δεν υπάρχει κανένας διάλογος. Οι δε πλατφόρμες για την ενδοσχολική βία είναι επιδερμικές λύσεις, για το φαίνεσθαι. Δεν προσφέρουν κάτι, την ίδια ώρα που το πρόβλημα φουντώνει».

--- Full Text ---
Στη σημερινή παγκόσμια οικονομία, οι φοιτητές αντιμετωπίζουν πιέσεις που ξεπερνούν κατά πολύ τις ακαδημαϊκές.
Οι μελετητές περιγράφουν όλο και περισσότερο τη σύγχρονη φοιτητική εμπειρία ως μια πράξη ισορροπίας, όπου η μάθηση, η εργασία και η ζωή διασταυρώνονται με πολύπλοκους τρόπους.
Οι δεξιότητες που θεωρούνται απαραίτητες για τους αποφοίτους — τεχνολογική παιδεία, επίλυση προβλημάτων, επικοινωνία, προσαρμοστικότητα και ανθεκτικότητα — συζητούνται συχνά, όπως έγινε παραδείγματος χάριν στο Παγκόσμιο Οικονομικό Φόρουμ, αλλά η πραγματικότητα πολύ πιο δυσοίωνη από ό,τι μπορούν να αποτυπώσουν οι λίστες δεξιοτήτων.
Σε όλες τις ηπείρους, πολλοί φοιτητές συνδυάζουν τις πλήρεις σπουδές με την απασχόληση, τον εθελοντισμό και την πρακτική εξάσκηση για να εξασφαλίσουν τόσο το παρόν όσο και το μέλλον τους.
Έρευνες δείχνουν ότι περισσότεροι από τους μισούς προπτυχιακούς φοιτητές παγκοσμίως ασχολούνται με κάποια μορφή εργασίας κατά τη διάρκεια του εξαμήνου, αντανακλώντας τόσο την οικονομική αναγκαιότητα όσο και την αυξανόμενη ζήτηση για εμπειρίες που ενσωματώνουν την εργασία.
Για πολλούς, αυτή η προσπάθεια να συνδυάσουν τις ευθύνες τους μοιάζει με παράσταση σε τσίρκο, όπου κάθε υποχρέωση αντιπροσωπεύει ένα διαφορετικό «βοηθητικό μέσο» που απαιτεί προσοχή και δεξιότητα.
Ένα αυξανόμενο σώμα ποιοτικής έρευνας υπογραμμίζει την ποικιλομορφία των εμπειριών των φοιτητών.
Φοιτητές από διαφορετικά υπόβαθρα — διεθνείς φοιτητές, φοιτητές πρώτης γενιάς και φοιτητές με αναπηρίες — αντιμετωπίζουν αυτές τις ευθύνες με διαφορετικό τρόπο, αντανακλώντας τις ανισότητες στην πρόσβαση σε πόρους, την οικογενειακή υποστήριξη και τα θεσμικά δίχτυα ασφαλείας.
Ο συνδυασμός των ακαδημαϊκών απαιτήσεων, των οικονομικών πιέσεων και της κοινωνικής προσαρμογής είναι ιδιαίτερα έντονος σε παγκοσμιοποιημένα περιβάλλοντα τριτοβάθμιας εκπαίδευσης, όπου τα ιδρύματα ανταποκρίνονται όλο και περισσότερο στις μεταβαλλόμενες ανάγκες των ανταγωνιστικών αγορών εργασίας.
Με βάση την εμπειρική παρατήρηση, Alison Taylor, καθηγήτρια στο Τμήμα Εκπαιδευτικών Σπουδών, περιγράφει σε πρόσφατο βιβλίο της, Juggling Rhythms, τις ποικίλες τακτικές (και δεξιότητες επιβίωσης) των φοιτητών ως «τέχνες του τσίρκου»
Πολλοί φοιτητές ισορροπούν ταυτόχρονα τις σπουδές, την αμειβόμενη εργασία, τις εθελοντικές δεσμεύσεις και τις οικογενειακές υποχρεώσεις.
Οι γυναίκες συχνά αντιμετωπίζουν πρόσθετες προσδοκίες λόγω των απαιτήσεων της φροντίδας, ενώ οι διεθνείς φοιτητές πρέπει να προσαρμοστούν σε νέα πολιτισμικά και θεσμικά περιβάλλοντα παράλληλα με το ακαδημαϊκό τους φόρτο εργασίας.
Όσοι έχουν ισχυρή κοινωνική υποστήριξη και προηγούμενη εμπειρία στην εργασία ή τις σπουδές τείνουν να αντιμετωπίζουν αυτές τις προκλήσεις με μεγαλύτερη ευελιξία.
Αντίθετα, οι φοιτητές με λιγότερους οικονομικούς ή θεσμικούς πόρους συχνά προχωρούν με προσοχή, προσπαθώντας να προβλέψουν τα εμπόδια και να αποφύγουν την εξάντληση.
Ωστόσο, η ακραία ευελιξία έχει το κόστος της.
Προβλήματα ψυχικής υγείας, άγχος και κίνδυνος εγκατάλειψης των σπουδών είναι κοινά μεταξύ των φοιτητών που πιέζονται υπερβολικά ως απάντηση στον υψηλό ανταγωνισμό και τις αυστηρές θεσμικές απαιτήσεις.
Ίσως η πιο επίπονη από αυτές τις «τέχνες του τσίρκου» είναι αυτό που ο Taylor αποκαλεί κατάποση σπαθιών: η καταστολή των φυσικών αμυντικών μηχανισμών και της ευημερίας μπροστά στην αμείλικτη ακαδημαϊκή και επαγγελματική πίεση.
Σε παγκόσμιο επίπεδο, οι φοιτητές αναφέρουν εξάντληση, άγχος και επιδείνωση της ψυχικής τους υγείας καθώς προσπαθούν να ανταποκριθούν στο γεγονός ότι ένα πτυχίο πανεπιστημίου δεν είναι πλέον αρκετό.
Το φαινόμενο αντανακλά μια ευρύτερη ένταση στην τριτοβάθμια εκπαίδευση.
Καθώς τα πανεπιστήμια δίνουν έμφαση στην δυνατότητα απασχόλησης, τη συσσώρευση τίτλων σπουδών και την παραγωγικότητα, οι φοιτητές αντιμετωπίζουν μια ιλιγγιώδη ποικιλία επιλογών και υποχρεώσεων.
Η πίεση για αριστεία μπορεί να επισκιάσει τη σημασία της προσωπικής ανάπτυξης, της αυτοφροντίδας και της αναστ
οχαστικής σκέψης σχετικά με τις αξίες και τις φιλοδοξίες του καθενός.
Οι παραλληλισμοί αυτοί, μας δείχνουν ότι απαιτείται αλλαγή προοπτικής.
Τα ιδρύματα τριτοβάθμιας εκπαίδευσης πρέπει να αναγνωρίσουν ότι ο χρονικός τους ορίζοντας —εστιασμένος στην έρευνα, τον προβληματισμό και τη δημιουργία γνώσης—διαφέρει από τον άμεσο ρυθμό της παγκόσμιας οικονομίας.
Η καινοτομία δεν απαιτεί αντίδραση σε κάθε έκθεση για την αγορά εργασίας, ούτε τα πανεπιστήμια πρέπει να αντιμετωπίζουν τους φοιτητές ως προϊόντα που πρέπει να βελτιστοποιηθούν αποκλειστικά για οικονομική απόδοση.
Αντ’ αυτού, τα πανεπιστημιακά ιδρύματα μπορούν να υποστηρίξουν τους φοιτητές παρέχοντας θεσμικές εγγυήσεις: ισότιμη πρόσβαση σε οικονομική υποστήριξη, ευέλικτες ακαδημαϊκές διαδρομές και ευκαιρίες για εξερεύνηση της προσωπικής και επαγγελματικής ταυτότητας χωρίς αδικαιολόγητη πίεση.
Εξίσου σημαντική είναι η ενθάρρυνση της καθοδήγησης, η προώθηση της στοχαστικής μελέτης και η προώθηση της ευημερίας των φοιτητών.
Οι εργοδότες έχουν επίσης ρόλο στη δημιουργία βιώσιμων, ανταποδοτικών θέσεων για αρχάριους, διασφαλίζοντας ότι το βάρος της προετοιμασίας για την καριέρα δεν βαρύνει αποκλειστικά τους φοιτητές.
Οι εμπειρίες των φοιτητών από το να ισορροπούν μεταξύ ευθυνών, να περπατούν σε τεντωμένο σχοινί, να κάνουν ακροβατικά και να καταπίνουν σπαθιά υπογραμμίζουν την πολυπλοκότητα της σύγχρονης εκπαίδευσης.
Ενώ η μεταφορά του τσίρκου αποτυπώνει τις δεξιότητες και τη δημιουργικότητα που φέρνουν οι φοιτητές στις σπουδές τους, φωτίζει επίσης τις συστημικές προκλήσεις που μπορούν να θέσουν σε κίνδυνο την ευημερία και τα μαθησιακά αποτελέσματα.
Σε διεθνές επίπεδο, τα πανεπιστήμια, οι υπεύθυνοι χάραξης πολιτικής και οι εργοδότες πρέπει να συνεργαστούν για να παρέχουν περιβάλλοντα όπου οι φοιτητές μπορούν να ευδοκιμήσουν χωρίς να θυσιάζουν την ψυχική τους υγεία, την προσωπική τους ανάπτυξη ή την κοινωνική ισότητα.
Η μείωση των φραγμών στα δίδακτρα, η προσφορά ισχυρής οικονομικής υποστήριξης και η προώθηση της υπομονετικής και προσεκτικής μελέτης είναι απαραίτητα βήματα.
Με αυτόν τον τρόπο, η τριτοβάθμια εκπαίδευση μπορεί να βοηθήσει τους φοιτητές να αναπτύξουν ανθεκτικότητα, προσαρμοστικότητα και ουσιαστική συμμετοχή — όχι απλώς δεξιότητες επιβίωσης σε μια απρόβλεπτη οικονομία.

Ραγδαίες είναι οι εξελίξεις στην υπόθεση της βόμβας που εξερράγη στα Βορίζια το βράδυ της Παρασκευής, 31 Οκτωβρίου, και πυροδότησε την αιματηρή συμπλοκή με τους δύο νεκρούς το πρωί της επόμενης ημέρας.
Όπως ανακοίνωσε η Αστυνομία το απόγευμα συνελήφθη ένας 23χρονος με την κατηγορία ότι ήταν αυτός που τοποθέτησε τον εκρηκτικό μηχανισμό.
Σύμφωνα με πληροφορίες πρόκειται για τον ανιψιό του 39χρονου Φανρούρη Καργάκη ο οποίος έχασε τη ζωή κατά την ανταλλαγή πυροβολισμών.
«Σε συνέχεια προηγούμενων ενημερώσεων, από τη συνεχιζόμενη έρευνα της Υποδιεύθυνσης Δίωξης και Εξιχνίασης Εγκλημάτων Ηρακλείου, συνελήφθη με σχετικό ένταλμα του αρμόδιου Ανακριτή, 23χρονος ημεδαπός, ο οποίος φέρεται να προέβη βραδινές ώρες της 31/10/2025 στην πράξη της έκρηξης σε οικία στα Βορίζια Ηρακλείου.
Προηγήθηκε κατάλληλη έρευνα, μετά και από σχετική παραγγελία της ανακριτικής Αρχής, κατά την οποία αξιολογήθηκαν και αξιοποιήθηκαν πληροφοριακά στοιχεία, οπτικό καθώς και λοιπό προανακριτικό υλικό, που είχε ως αποτέλεσμα την ταυτοποίηση του φερόμενου δράστη.
Ο ανωτέρω εντοπίστηκε σήμερα (12/11/2025) το απόγευμα από αστυνομικούς του Τ.Α.Ε. Μεσσαράς στα Βορίζια, όπου και συνελήφθη δυνάμει του εντάλματος σύλληψης.
Για οποιαδήποτε περαιτέρω εξέλιξη, θα ακολουθήσει νεότερη ενημέρωση».
Οι έρευνες συνεχίζονται προκειμένου να εντοπιστεί και το άτομο που κατασκεύασε τη βόμβα.
Η αστυνομία έχει επικεντρώσει τις έρευνες στις φυλακές Αλικαρνασσού και τις προηγούμενες ημέρες τρία μέλη της οικογένειας Καργάκη που κρατούνται για υπόθεση ζωοκλοπής και άλλα δύο άτομα από άλλη οικογένεια είχαν οδηγηθεί στην ανακρίτρια προκειμένου να δώσουν απαντήσεις για τη βόμβα στα Βορίζια,
Η αστυνομία εκτιμά ότι μέσα από τη φυλακή οργανώθηκε η βομβιστική επίθεση και από εκεί δόθηκε η παραγγελία για την κατασκευή του εκρηκτικού μηχανισμού.
Υπενθυμίζεται ότι το μεσημέρι εκείνης της Παρασκευής ο Φανούρης Καργάκης είχε επισκεφθεί τις φυλακές Αλικαρνασσού και είχε συναντήσει τα συγγενικά του πρόσωπα. Λίγες ώρες αργότερα σημειώθηκε η βομβιστική που πυροδότησε την αιματηρή συμπλοκή το πρωί τις επόμενης ημέρας.

Η κυβέρνηση της Σουηδίας ανακοίνωσε σήμερα πως κάλεσε την Amazon και άλλες πλατφόρμες ηλεκτρονικού εμπορίου σε μια συνάντηση προκειμένου να δώσουν εξηγήσεις σχετικά με την πώληση κούκλων του σεξ με παιδική εμφάνιση.
Η Amazon δήλωσε πως θα συμμετάσχει στη συνάντηση και πως απέσυρε τα εν λόγω προϊόντα
Αυτή η απόφαση λαμβάνει χώρα αφού η σουηδική οργάνωση προάσπισης των δικαιωμάτων των παιδιών ChildX ανακοίνωσε τη Δευτέρα πως κατέθεσε μήνυση σε βάρος του αμερικανικού κολοσσού διαδικτυακού εμπορίου και άλλων δύο ιστότοπων που πωλούσαν αυτές τις κούκλες στη Σουηδία, κρίνοντας πως αυτό αντίκειται στους νόμους για τη σεξουαλική εκμετάλλευση ανηλίκων.
Σύμφωνα με τη ΜΚΟ, η πώληση τέτοιων προϊόντων σε διεθνείς πλατφόρμες ενέχει τον κίνδυνο να κανονικοποιηθούν οι σεξουαλικές επιθέσεις εναντίον παιδιών και να αυξηθεί η ζήτηση για περιεχόμενα που εκμεταλλεύονται παιδιά.
Η Amazon δήλωσε ότι απέσυρε τα εν λόγω προϊόντα.
Όπως αναφέρει το ΑΠΕ-ΜΠΕ, η υπουργός Κοινωνικών Υπηρεσιών της Σουηδίας κάλεσε τους ιστότοπους κοινωνικής δικτύωσης, όπως και τους οργανισμούς προάσπισης των δικαιωμάτων των παιδιών και άλλες αρχές σε μια συνάντηση την 28η Νοεμβρίου, προκειμένου να συζητήσουν τους τρόπους για την αντιμετώπιση αυτού του προβλήματος.
«Πρέπει να εξερευνήσουμε μαζί τις δυνατότητες να τερματιστεί η ύπαρξη αυτών των κούκλων», δήλωσε η υπουργός Κοινωνικών Υπηρεσιών Καμίλα Βάλτερσον Γκρόνβαλ, σε ένα δελτίο Τύπου.
Η Amazon δήλωσε στο Γαλλικό Πρακτορείο Ειδήσεων πως θα συμμετάσχει στη συνάντηση και πως απέσυρε τα εν λόγω προϊόντα.
«Εφαρμόζουμε αυστηρές πολιτικές και οδηγίες στον τομέα των προϊόντων για ενήλικες και απαγορεύουμε αυστηρά την παιδική πορνογραφία», δήλωσε ένας εκπρόσωπος Τύπου της Amazon.
Η ChildX αξιώνει η Amazon να αναλάβει περαιτέρω τις ευθύνες της σχετικά με τα προϊόντα που πωλούνται στις πλατφόρμες της.
Η μήνυση της ΜΚΟ κατατέθηκε αφού η πλατφόρμα Shein, ιδρυθείσα στην Κίνα, απειλήθηκε με αναστολή λειτουργίας στη Γαλλία έπειτα από την ανακάλυψη στον ιστότοπό της κούκλων του σεξ με παιδική εμφάνιση και όπλων κατηγορίας Α.

Την 9η Φεβρουαρίου ως Παγκόσμια Ημέρα Ελληνικής Γλώσσας ανακήρυξε η 43η γενική διάσκεψη της UNESCO , μετά την ολοκλήρωση των εργασιών της στη Σαμαρκάνδη του Ουζμπεκιστάν.
Όπως γνωστοποίησε το υπουργείο Εξωτερικών, «σήμερα , 12 Νοεμβρίου 2025, με την ολοκλήρωση των εργασιών της 43ης Γενικής Διάσκεψης της UNESCO, στη Σαμαρκάνδη του Ουζμπεκιστάν, υιοθετήθηκε και επικυρώθηκε ομόφωνα η απόφαση της ανακήρυξης της 9ης Φεβρουαρίου ως Παγκόσμιας Ημέρας Ελληνικής Γλώσσας».
Σύμφωνα με το υπουργείο Εξωτερικών, «ολοκληρώθηκε έτσι και τυπικά η μακρά διαδικασία που είχε εκκινήσει, τον περασμένο Απρίλιο, με την απόφαση του Εκτελεστικού Συμβουλίου της UNESCO, μετά από πρόταση που είχε τότε υποβάλει η Ελλάδα με την υποστήριξη 90 κρατών-μελών του Οργανισμού».
Τέλος, το υπουργείο Εξωτερικών επισήμανε ότι «η διεθνής αναγνώριση της μοναδικής και ανεκτίμητης συμβολής της ελληνικής γλώσσας στην παγκόσμια πολιτιστική κληρονομιά της ανθρωπότητας συνιστά απόφαση ιστορικής σημασίας στην 3.000 ετών διαχρονία της γλώσσας μας».

Title       : «Ανακαινίζω – Νοικιάζω»: Ανακλήθηκαν σχεδόν 3.000 αιτήσεις με παρατυπίες – Οι 1.200 στην Ηλεία

--- Summary ---
Σε μια περίπτωση στην Ηλεία, το ίδιο ακίνητο δηλώθηκε από 20 διαφορετικούς πολίτες, σύμφωνα με τη Δόμνα Μιχαηλίδου.

--- Full Text ---
Εκτεταμένες παρατυπίες εντοπίστηκαν στο πρόγραμμα «Ανακαινίζω – Νοικιάζω», το οποίο δίνει τη δυνατότητα στους πολίτες να ανακαινίσουν κενά ακίνητα και στη συνέχεια να τα διαθέσουν προς ενοικίαση, αυξάνοντας έτσι την προσφορά κατοικίας στην αγορά, όπως τόνισε η υπουργός Κοινωνικής Συνοχής και Οικογένειας, Δόμνα Μιχαηλίδου.
Μιλώντας στην εκπομπή «Συνδέσεις» του ERTnews, η κ. Μιχαηλίδου ανέφερε χαρακτηριστικά ότι, «κατά τον έλεγχο των αιτήσεων, διαπιστώσαμε ότι πολλές αφορούσαν τα ίδια ακίνητα. Συνολικά, προχωρήσαμε σε 2.978 ανακλήσεις αιτήσεων σε όλη τη χώρα, εκ των οποίων οι 1.200 αφορούσαν μόνο την Ηλεία».
Η υπουργός σημείωσε, δε, ότι οι ανακλήσεις έγιναν πριν δοθεί οποιαδήποτε προκαταβολή, διασφαλίζοντας έτσι την προστασία των δημοσίων πόρων.
«Οι αριθμοί αποδεικνύουν την αποτελεσματικότητα των ελέγχων. Είναι χαρακτηριστική η περίπτωση στην Ηλεία, όπου το ίδιο ακίνητο δηλώθηκε από είκοσι διαφορετικούς πολίτες. Το υπουργείο εντόπισε τις αστοχίες και ανέστειλε εγκαίρως τις αιτήσεις, προστατεύοντας τα χρήματα των φορολογουμένων», σημείωσε.
Παράλληλα, επισήμανε πως η διαδικασία αυτή δίνει τη δυνατότητα σε νέους δικαιούχους να ενταχθούν στο πρόγραμμα. «Οι πόροι που δεν διατέθηκαν θα κατευθυνθούν σε πολίτες που πληρούν πραγματικά τα κριτήρια. Αυτή είναι η ουσία της κοινωνικής πολιτικής: δικαιοσύνη, διαφάνεια και ουσιαστική στήριξη των πολιτών», σημείωσε.
Η κ. Μιχαηλίδου αναφέρθηκε και στις αλλαγές στην προσβασιμότητα, επισημαίνοντας ότι με τη νέα Κοινή Υπουργική Απόφαση απλουστεύονται οι διαδικασίες για πολίτες με αναπηρία, ενισχύονται οι παρεχόμενες υπηρεσίες και καλύπτονται εξατομικευμένες ανάγκες τόσο εντός όσο και εκτός κατοικίας.
«Η κοινωνική πολιτική δεν περιορίζεται στην παροχή. Οφείλει να δημιουργεί συνθήκες ανεξαρτησίας, συμμετοχής και αξιοπρέπειας για όλους», τόνισε.

--- Summary ---
Σε πλήρη λειτουργία βρίσκεται από σήμερα ο «κόφτης» στις συνεδριάσεις της Ολομέλειας. Κλείνει το μικρόφωνο όταν ο ομιλητής υπερβαίνει τον προβλεπόμενο χρόνο.

--- Full Text ---
Από σήμερα ξεκίνησε και επίσημα στη Βουλή η εφαρμογή του «χρονοκόφτη», του νέου αυτόματου συστήματος που περιορίζει τον χρόνο ομιλίας των βουλευτών, υπουργών και πολιτικών αρχηγών, όταν υπερβαίνουν το προβλεπόμενο όριο.
Πλέον, ο βουλευτής έχει δύο λεπτά να θέσει τα ερωτήματά του στον αρμόδιο υπουργό και ένα λεπτό ανοχής. Στα 120 δευτερόλεπτα ακούγεται ένας ήχος και αμέσως μετά ο πίνακας μπροστά του γίνεται κίτρινος για ένα λεπτό, κάτι που αποτελεί προειδοποίηση, ότι μόλις παρέλθει θα γίνει κόκκινος και θα κλείσει το μικρόφωνο. Τότε κάμερα θα γυρίσει στην Ολομέλεια και ο βουλευτής θα πρέπει να δώσει τη θέση του στον επόμενο.
Στην πρώτη επίκαιρη ερώτηση με το νέο σύστημα ο βουλευτής του ΠΑΣΟΚ, Μιχάλης Κατρίνης, ανέφερε πως ενδέχεται να υπερβεί τον χρόνο «για να δει αν δουλεύει και το σύστημα», το οποίο φάνηκε να λειτουργεί κανονικά, καθώς εκεί που μιλούσε ο ήχος έκλεισε και η κάμερα έδειξε τον αντιπρόεδρο της Βουλής, Αθανάσιο Μπούρα.
Λίγο αργότερα, τον λόγο πήρε η πρόεδρος της Πλεύσης Ελευθερίας, Ζωή Κωνσταντοπούλου και έκανε λόγο για φωτογραφική διάταξη που στόχο έχει εκείνη και το κόμμα της.

«Οι νέοι δεν στηρίζονται με μεγάλα λόγια αλλά με πράξεις», δήλωσε ο πρωθυπουργός στην ανάρτησή του.

--- Full Text ---
Με ένα βίντεο στο TikTok, ο πρωθυπουργός, Κυριάκος Μητσοτάκης παρουσίασε εκ νέου τα βασικά μέτρα φοροελαφρύνσεων για τους νέους που ψηφίστηκαν πριν από λίγες μέρες στη Βουλή.
Πρόκειται για τις εξαγγελίες της ΔΕΘ, με τον πρωθυπουργό να εμφανίζεται στο επίμαχο βίντεο να παρακολουθεί από το λάπτοπ του ένα γκάλοπ στο οποίο νέοι άνθρωποι ερωτώνται τι γνωρίζουν για τα νέα μέτρα.
«Μάλλον οι νέοι με τους οποίους μιλήσαμε δεν είχαν πολύ καλή ενημέρωση γι’ αυτά που τους αφορούν», είπε ο πρωθυπουργός, σχολιάζοντας τις απαντήσεις.
«Ενα από τα πιο σημαντικά μέτρα που ψηφίσαμε είναι ο μηδενισμός. Επαναλαμβάνω ο μηδενισμός του φόρου εισοδήματος στους νέους ώς 25 ετών με εισόδημα έως 20.000 ευρώ», συνέχισε, δίνοντας δύο παραδείγματα.
«Ενας νέος με 980 ευρώ καθαρό εισόδημα τον μήνα θα έχει πλέον μηδενικό φόρο. Επαναλαμβάνω, μηδενικό. Αυτό σημαίνει ότι από τον Ιανουάριο ο καθαρός μισθός του θα αυξηθεί κατά 91 ευρώ και από τα 980 ευρώ θα πάει στα 1.071 καθαρά. Δηλαδή σε ετήσια βάση το όφελός του θα είναι σχεδόν 1.300 ευρώ. Πάνω από ένα επιπλέον μισθό τον χρόνο. Αντίστοιχα, νέος ελεύθερος επαγγελματίας 25 ετών με ετήσιο καθαρό εισόδημα 13.000 ευρώ και αυτός θα έχει μηδενικό φόρο, βάζοντας στην τσέπη του επιπλέον 2.000 ευρώ ετησίως. Οι νέοι δεν στηρίζονται με μεγάλα λόγια αλλά με πράξεις. Γιατί σας θέλουμε πρωταγωνιστές σε μια Ελλάδα που αλλάζει», σημείωσε ο κ. Μητσοτάκης.
@kyriakosmitsotakis_ Στηρίζουμε τους νέους με πράξεις, όχι με μεγάλα λόγια.

«Την πορεία των πραγμάτων στο κόμμα μας και ευρύτερα στον αριστερό χώρο δεν μπορεί παρά να την καθορίσει η βάση του κόμματος και ο κόσμος της Αριστεράς», δήλωσε ο Αλέξης Χαρίτσης.

--- Full Text ---
«Να ανοίξει η συζήτηση» στη βάση της Νέας Αριστεράς για τη μελλοντική της πορεία ζητά ο πρόεδρος του κόμματος, Αλέξης Χαρίτσης, δηλώνοντας πως ο ίδιος θεωρεί ότι «αυτό που έχει σημασία σήμερα είναι η ενότητα και η ανασυγκρότηση».
«Η (Νέα) Αριστερά σε σταυροδρόμι», γράφει σε μακροσκελή σημερινή του ανάρτηση, υπενθυμίζοντας πως «στην Αριστερά, ιστορικά, υπάρχουν δύο αποκλίνουσες προσεγγίσεις για το ποια πρέπει να είναι η στάση της σε στιγμές κρίσης».
«Η πρώτη επιμένει στη λογική της αυτόνομης πορείας και σε έναν σκληρό πυρήνα ιδεολογικών και πολιτικών αναφορών. Κατά κανόνα, είναι μια στάση περιχαράκωσης και αναδίπλωσης στο όνομα των αντίξοων συνθηκών. Η δεύτερη αναζητεί τη διέξοδο σε μέτωπα με όμορες ιδεολογικά κοινωνικές και πολιτικές δυνάμεις. Κατά κανόνα, είναι μια στάση που προκύπτει από τη λογική του κατεπείγοντος. Αυτά που μας ενώνουν, είναι περισσότερα από αυτά που μας χωρίζουν. Αυτές οι δύο γραμμές βρίσκονται σε διάλογο, συγκρούονται και συντίθενται. Αλλά σε κάθε στροφή, μία είναι αυτή που δίνει τον τόνο», εξηγεί ο Αλ. Χαρίτσης και συμπληρώνει:
«Είναι γνωστό ότι στη Νέα Αριστερά υπάρχουν διαφορετικές απόψεις για το πώς οφείλουμε να κινηθούμε από εδώ και πέρα. Και αυτό είναι απολύτως λογικό και θεμιτό».
Oσον αφορά τη δική του θέση την οποία, όπως λέει, έχει διατυπώσει «ρητά και ανοιχτά», επισημαίνει: «Δεν είναι μόνο προσωπική θέση. Είναι η θέση του ιδρυτικού συνεδρίου της Νέας Αριστεράς: Λαϊκό Μέτωπο με κοινό πρόγραμμα απέναντι στο καθεστώς Μητσοτάκη και στην άνοδο της Ακροδεξιάς».
«Πιστεύω ακράδαντα ότι αυτή η θέση επικοινωνεί με το βασικό αίτημα των αριστερών και προοδευτικών πολιτών στην Ελλάδα του 2025.
Και πιστεύω, επίσης, ότι εκφράζει και την πλειοψηφία των οργανωμένων μελών της Νέας Αριστεράς. Iσως κάνω λάθος. Oμως αυτό είναι κάτι που πρέπει να το διαπιστώσουμε: τι πιστεύουν οι άνθρωποι που παλεύουν για τη Νέα Αριστερά. Το θεωρώ ζήτημα πολιτικής εντιμότητας και κομματικής δημοκρατίας», τονίζει και προσθέτει:
«Βρισκόμαστε σε μια στιγμή που το κοινωνικό αίτημα είναι η ενότητα των δυνάμεων της πληθυντικής Αριστεράς και του προοδευτικού χώρου συνολικότερα. Και μόνο μέσα από έναν ευρύ πόλο συσπείρωσης δυνάμεων που θα αντιπαρατεθεί πειστικά με τη Δεξιά, θα μπορέσουν να εκφραστούν και τα πιο δυναμικά, τα πιο ζωντανά στρώματα της ελληνικής κοινωνίας. Oλοι εκείνοι και εκείνες που ασφυκτιούν και αναζητούν διέξοδο, που επιδιώκουν την πολιτική αλλαγή. Οι άνθρωποι κινητοποιούνται και παίρνουν την υπόθεση στα χέρια τους όταν νιώθουν ότι εμφανίζεται μια δύναμη που εκφράζει τα υλικά τους συμφέροντα, επικοινωνεί με τις ιδέες τους, συνδέεται με αιτήματα που συμπυκνώνουν τα μεγάλα διακυβεύματα της εποχής μας και μπορεί να αλλάξει τους συσχετισμούς. Γι’ αυτό και θεωρώ ότι αυτό που έχει σημασία σήμερα είναι η ενότητα και η ανασυγκρότηση. Με αυτό που λείπει: αιχμές. Εντός αυτού του πόλου προφανώς θα υπάρχουν διαφορετικές απόψεις, τάσεις και ρεύματα. Και εκεί θέλω να δω τη Νέα Αριστερά».
«Γιατί η Νέα Αριστερά μπορεί να έχει πρωταγωνιστικό ρόλο στην υπόθεση αυτή. Γιατί έχει προωθημένες προγραμματικές θέσεις. Γιατί έχει την έγνοια της εφαρμογής της αριστερής πολιτικής στο σήμερα. Στα μεγάλα επίδικα της εποχής μας, στα καθημερινά προβλήματα και τις αγωνίες της κοινωνίας. Και γι’ αυτό θεωρώ ότι τα μέλη της Νέας Αριστεράς πρέπει να έχουν τη δυνατότητα να εκφράσουν την άποψή τους», συνεχίζει ο Αλ. Χαρίτσης, επισημαίνοντας πως «η πλειοψηφία της Κεντρικής Επιτροπής διαφωνεί».
«Ακούω την πολιτική διαφωνία. Δεν συμφωνώ, αλλά την ακούω. Νιώθω όμως ότι δεν πρέπει ένα κομματικό παρελθόν που παλαιότερα μας ταλάνισε, γιατί κομματικές δομές αφέθηκαν να μη δουλεύουν, να λειτουργεί τόσο τραυματικά ακόμα ώστε να μας οδηγεί στην αμφισβήτηση της ανοιχτότητας, στην άρνηση της δημοκρατικής συζήτησης, στον συγκεντρωτισμό, στην αυτάρκεια των δομών που δεν ανασαίνουν», σημειώνει και καταλήγει:
«Να ανοίξουμε λοιπόν τη συζήτηση. Σε τελευταία ανάλυση, σε αυτή την κρίσιμη συγκυρία, την πορεία των πραγμάτων στο κόμμα μας και ευρύτερα στον αριστερό χώρο δεν μπορεί παρά να την καθορίσει η βάση του κόμματος και ο κόσμος της Αριστεράς».

«Συγκινούμαι κάθε φορά που μιλώ για τον Αγγελο. Γιατί ήταν -έτσι τον έχω στη μνήμη και την καρδιά μου- ένας πολύ δικός μου άνθρωπος», αναφέρει ο πρώην πρωθυπουργός Κώστας Καραμανλής σε μήνυμα που απέστειλε στην εκδήλωση «Μνήμη Αγγελου Μοσχονά», που πραγματοποίησαν ο «Σύλλογος των Αθηναίων» και οι φίλοι της «Κερκίδας του Στίβου».
«Πολιτικοί σαν τον Μοσχονά, που βάζουν το “εμείς” πάνω από το “εγώ”, που μόνη φιλοδοξία τους είναι να προσφέρουν στον τόπο και στους συνανθρώπους τους, χωρίς να προσμένουν ή να διαπραγματεύονται ανταλλάγματα, στις μέρες μας είναι περισσότερο από ποτέ αναγκαίοι.

Για να ανοίξει ένας νέος, ενάρετος κύκλος στη δημόσια ζωή», επισημαίνει ο πρώην πρωθυπουργός.
Ολόκληρο το μήνυμα του κ. Καραμανλκή έχει ως εξής:
«Θέλω να συγχαρώ τους διοργανωτές της σημερινής συνάντησης, αφιερωμένης στον αείμνηστο κοινό μας φίλο Αγγελο Μοσχονά. Λυπάμαι γιατί από καιρού προγραμματισμένες υποχρεώσεις μου στο εξωτερικό δεν μου επιτρέπουν να είμαι μαζί σας. Συγκινούμαι κάθε φορά που μιλώ για τον Αγγελο. Γιατί ήταν -έτσι τον έχω στη μνήμη και την καρδιά μου- ένας πολύ δικός μου άνθρωπος. Σε όλη του τη ζωή συνεπής αγωνιστής αρχών και αξιών.
Ακούραστος εργάτης, στην υπηρεσία των συμπολιτών μας. Είκοσι τρία χρόνια, από το 1987 έως το 2010, αντιδήμαρχος Αθηναίων, πάντα παρών στη μάχη της καθημερινότητας, για τη βελτίωση της ποιότητας ζωής των πολιτών. Φλογερός ιδεολόγος, στην πρώτη γραμμή των αγώνων της παράταξης για ελευθερία, δημοκρατία, κοινωνική δικαιοσύνη. Μια ζωή οννεδίτης! Θιασώτης της ανανέωσης και της ανατροφοδότησης του δημόσιου βίου με νέες αντιλήψεις και πρόσωπα. Υπήρξε μέντορας δεκάδων νέων παιδιών, στα πρώτα τους βήματα στην πολιτική διαδικασία. Κυρίως μέσα από τη συμμετοχή τους στη ΔΑΠ. Σε περιόδους μάλιστα που για τους φοιτητές και σπουδαστές που εκπροσωπούσαν τον φιλελεύθερο χώρο απαιτείτο περίσσευμα τόλμης, συγκρότησης και αυτοπεποίθησης -θα έλεγα και άγνοια κινδύνου- στο να εκφραστούν, να επιχειρηματολογήσουν, να διαφωνήσουν, να διεκδικήσουν. Θα θυμάμαι πάντα τον Αγγελο ως καθοδηγητή μου, το μακρινό 1975, στη ΔΑΠ Νομικής, όταν με παρότρυνε και με προετοίμασε να κάνω την πρώτη ομιλία μου στη συνέλευση της σχολής. Ηταν για εμένα πραγματικό ”βάπτισμα πυρός”, σε ένα κατάμεστο αμφιθέατρο, που έβραζε μόνο με το άκουσμα του ονόματός μου.
Φίλες και φίλοι,
Η μακρά πορεία του Αγγελου Μοσχονά αναδεικνύει τις αρετές της πίστης σε έναν κόσμο δικαιοσύνης, αλληλεγγύης και ανθρωπιάς, Της αφοσίωσης σε αρχές και αξίες. Της ανιδιοτέλειας, της εντιμότητας, της προσφοράς. Της αγωνιστικής διεκδίκησης δικαιωμάτων και ενός καλύτερου αύριο για τους πολλούς και τους λιγότερο ευνοημένους. Θα τον θυμόμαστε όχι μόνο ως έναν πληθωρικό, αεικίνητο και πεισματάρη πολιτικό, αλλά και ως έναν άνθρωπο διαλεκτικό, με ευαισθησίες, με καλλιτεχνικές ανησυχίες και αναζητήσεις. Πολιτικοί σαν τον Μοσχονά, που βάζουν το “εμείς” πάνω από το “εγώ”, που μόνη φιλοδοξία τους είναι να προσφέρουν στον τόπο και τους συνανθρώπους τους, χωρίς να προσμένουν ή να διαπραγματεύονται ανταλλάγματα, στις μέρες μας είναι περισσότερο από ποτέ αναγκαίοι. Για να αναστραφεί η πορεία απαξίωσης της πολιτικής. Να αποκατασταθεί η εμπιστοσύνη των πολιτών στους θεσμούς. Για να ανοίξει ένας νέος, ενάρετος κύκλος στη δημόσια ζωή».

Ο Ελληνας υπουργός Ενέργειας και Περιβάλλοντος Σταύρος Παπασταύρου και ο Κύπριος ομόλογός του Γιώργος Παπαναστασίου συναντήθηκαν με τον Ευρωπαίο επίτροπο Ενέργειας Νταν Γιόργκενσεν στις Βρυξέλλες όπου, σύμφωνα με την Αθήνα, τον ενημέρωσαν για τις συμφωνίες που αποφασίστηκαν την προηγούμενη εβδομάδα στην Αθήνα με τους Αμερικανούς υπουργούς.
Ο κ. Παπασταύρου δήλωσε πως οι συμφωνίες αυτές οδηγούν στην απεξάρτηση της Ευρώπης από το ρωσικό φυσικό αέριο, συνιστώντας στροφή προς το αμερικανικό, με κύρια πύλη εισόδου την Ελλάδα.
Για τη διασύνδεση Ελλάδας – Κύπρου
«Συζητήσαμε επίσης για τα αποτελέσματα της πρωτοβουλίας 3+1 που είχαμε με τον Κύπριο υπουργό και τους υπουργούς Ενέργειας των Ηνωμένων Πολιτειών και του Ισραήλ. Υπογραμμίσαμε την ανάγκη να επικαιροποιήσουμε τα οικονομικά και τεχνικά στοιχεία της ηλεκτρικής διασύνδεσης Κύπρου και Ελλάδας, όπως δήλωσαν πριν λίγες ώρες ο Ελληνας πρωθυπουργός και ο Κύπριος πρόεδρος ενόψει και του δυνητικού επενδυτικού ενδιαφέροντος», πρόσθεσε ο κ. Παπασταύρου.
Οπως είπε ο ίδιος, κατά τη διάρκεια της συνάντησης επισημάνθηκε και η ανάγκη «γρήγορων κινήσεων» στην Ευρώπη, ώστε να ενισχυθούν τα έργα συνδεσιμότητας και να αποκλιμακωθεί η τιμή της ενέργειας για νοικοκυριά και επιχειρήσεις.
Παπαναστασίου: Ανάγκη για «βιωσιμότητα» του καλωδίου
Ο υπουργός Ενέργειας της Κύπρου Γιώργος Παπαναστασίου δήλωσε σχετικά: «Εχουμε καταλήξει ότι το διασυνοριακό έργο πρέπει να περάσει σε μια επικαιροποίηση, έστω και στο οικονομικό κομμάτι. Η πιο σημαντική παράμετρος αυτής της μελέτης είναι να προσελκύσουμε ισχυρούς επενδυτές, οι οποίοι θα έχουν τη δυνατότητα να υλοποιήσουν το έργο, ώστε οι προκλήσεις γύρω από το οικονομικό και πιθανόν και το τεχνικό κομμάτι να είναι βιώσιμες».
Ο Κύπριος υπουργός τόνισε πως στόχος είναι η εξεύρεση «ισχυρών παικτών και ταμείων που θα μπορούν να ενισχύσουν οικονομικά το έργο».
Προτεραιότητα τα διασυνοριακά έργα
Αναφερόμενος στην επερχόμενη προεδρία της Κύπρου στην Ευρωπαϊκή Ενωση, τόνισε ότι μία από τις προτεραιότητες θα είναι τα διασυνοριακά έργα και τα ενεργειακά δίκτυα, καθώς και η προστασία των ενεργειακών έργων που βρίσκονται σε εξέλιξη, όπως και αυτή του έργου του Great Interconnector.
Ο κ. Παπαναστασίου έκανε λόγο για ένα πάρα πολύ σημαντικό έργο, το οποίο θα τερματίσει την ενεργειακή απομόνωση της Κυπριακής Δημοκρατίας, «του τελευταίου κράτους-μέλους της Ε.Ε. που δεν είναι συνδεδεμένο με το ευρωπαϊκό δίκτυο».
«Η διάσταση 3+1, την οποία ανέφερε ο φίλος υπουργός, είναι ιδιαίτερα σημαντική, καθώς η μηδενική πλέον παροχή ρωσικού φυσικού αερίου δίνει λύσεις μέσα από τον κάθετο διάδρομο, ο οποίος ξεκινά από την Αλεξανδρούπολη και φτάνει στην Ουκρανία μέσω άλλων χωρών».
Ο ίδιος τόνισε ότι η Κυπριακή Δημοκρατία μπορεί να συμβάλει μέσα από τα κοιτάσματα, εκτιμώντας πως σύντομα θα είναι διαθέσιμες και οι πρώτες ποσότητες φυσικού αερίου που θα υγροποιηθούν μέσω Αιγύπτου.

Έρχεται η Black Friday 2025, φέρνοντας κύμα εκπτώσεων και προσφορών σε όλη την αγορά. Πότε αναμένεται να μείνουν ανοιχτά τα καταστήματα, ενόψει και της Cyber Monday που ακολουθεί.
Η αγορά ετοιμάζεται και φέτος για τη Black Friday , με καταστήματα και ηλεκτρονικά e-shops να προετοιμάζουν μεγάλες εκπτώσεις και προσφορές σε πλήθος προϊόντων.
Φέτος, η Black Friday θα πραγματοποιηθεί την Παρασκευή 28 Νοεμβρίου , σηματοδοτώντας την έναρξη της περιόδου των μεγάλων προσφορών. Οι καταναλωτές ήδη λαμβάνουν διαφημιστικά μηνύματα και ενημερώσεις, καθώς οι επιχειρήσεις επιστρατεύουν προεκπτώσεις για να προσελκύσουν το ενδιαφέρον του κοινού.
Αμέσως μετά, ακολουθεί η Cyber Monday, που φέτος πέφτει τη Δευτέρα 1 Δεκεμβρίου , με προσφορές κυρίως σε τεχνολογικά προϊόντα και ηλεκτρονικές αγορές.
Παράλληλα, την Κυριακή 30 Νοεμβρίου τα καταστήματα θα είναι προαιρετικά ανοιχτά , δίνοντας στους καταναλωτές τη δυνατότητα να επωφεληθούν από τις εκπτώσεις και το Σαββατοκύριακο. Ωστόσο, επειδή το άνοιγμα δεν είναι υποχρεωτικό, συνιστάται οι ενδιαφερόμενοι να επιβεβαιώσουν εκ των προτέρων αν το κατάστημα που επιθυμούν θα λειτουργεί εκείνη την ημέρα.
Ανακοινώσεις για το ωράριο λειτουργίας των εμπορικών κέντρων και πολυκαταστημάτων αναμένονται το αργότερο έως τα τέλη της επόμενης εβδομάδας.

Μητσοτάκης- Χριστοδουλίδης αποφάσισαν την άμεση επικαιροποίηση των οικονομικοτεχνικών παραμέτρων του καλωδίου ηλεκτρικής διασύνδεσης, με στόχο την είσοδο νέων επενδυτών
Σήμα για να “ξεκολλήσει” το έργο του καλωδίου ηλεκτρικής διασύνδεσης Ελλάδας- Κύπρου έδωσαν μετά τη συνάντηση τους, στο πλαίσιο της 3ης διακυβερνητικής συνόδου των δύο χωρών, ο πρωθυπουργός, Κυριάκος Μητσοτάκης, και ο Κύπριος πρόεδρος, Νίκος Χριστοδουλίδης.
Ο κ. Μητσοτάκης ανέφερε ειδικότερα ότι συζήτησαν την εμβάθυνση της περιφερειακής συνεργασίας απέναντι σε κοινές προκλήσεις.
“Ο φίλος Νίκος συμμερίζεται την άποψη ότι τα νέα δεδομένα καθιστούν πιο βαρύνουσα την προστιθέμενη αξία που έχουν έργα διασυνδεσιμότητας . Έργα με εθνική διάσταση και για τις δύο χώρες και ευρύτερο γεωπολιτικό αποτύπωμα ”, συνέχισε και ανακοίνωσε ότι:
“Σύμφωνήσαμε την άμεση επικαιροποίηση των οικονομικοτεχνικών παραμέτρων του καλωδίου ώστε δυνητικά να ενισχυθεί και με την είσοδο νέων ισχυρών επενδυτών, κάτι που θα είναι προς όφελος όλων μας” .

Από την πλευρά του ο κ. Χριστοδουλίδης υπογράμμισε τη σημασία υλοποίησης έργων με αποτύπωμα και επιβεβαίωσε τη συμφωνία για επικαιροποίηση των οικονομικοτεχνικών παραμέτρων “για έργα γεωστρατηγικής σημασίας που άπτονται της συνδεσιμότητας” .
Ο πρόεδρος της Κύπρου δήλωσε επίσης ότι οι δύο χώρες θα αξιοποιήσουν και τις δυνατότητες σε ευρωπαϊκό επίπεδο , όπως το πρόγραμμα SAFE για την ενδυνάμωση των αμυντικών βιομηχανιών τους.

Παράλληλα, ο κ.Μητσοτάκης αναφέρθηκε στο σχήμα 3+1 (Ελλάδα, Κύπρος, Ισραήλ και ΗΠΑ), το οποίο ενεργοποιήθηκε εκ νέου στο πλαίσιο της συνόδου για τα ενεργειακά στην Αθήνα. “Αυτές είναι συμπράξεις ζωτικής σημασίας για τη διαμόρφωση του ενεργειακού και γεωπολιτικού χάρτη της επόμενης 15ετίας και τη συνολική σταθερότητα της περιοχής”, υπογράμμισε ο πρωθυπουργός. Τόνισε άλλωστε τη στρατηγική σημασία και των δύο χωρών για το σύνολο της Ευρώπης.
“Αθήνα και Λευκωσία δίνουν έμφαση στην ειρηνική συνεργασία με βάση το διεθνές δίκαιο και το δίκαιο της θάλασσας. Σε μία συγκυρία αβεβαιότητας, οι δύο χώρες μας είναι πυλώνες σταθερότητας και αξιοπιστίας στην περιοχή” , δήλωσε άλλωστε ο κ.Μητσοτάκης.
Επισήμανε δε ότι αυτό “αποτυπώθηκε έμπρακτα και με τις σημαντικές συμφωνίες με αμερικανικές εταιρείες, που έρχονται  να συμβάλλουν στην ενεργειακή ασφάλεια όλης της Ευρώπης από τη Μεσόγειο ως τη Μολδαβία”.
Έκανε λόγο για συμφωνίες με ισχυρό εθνικό πρόσημο και πρόσθεσε: “Εμείς ακολουθούμε την Κύπρο στις γεωτρήσεις. Ανοίξαμε ένα νέο ιστορικό κεφάλαιο. Μετά από 40 χρόνια το πρώτο ερευνητικό γεωτρύπανο θα πιάσει δουλειά στο Ιόνιο μέσα στους επόμενους 18 μήνες. Θέλουμε την πράσινη μετάβαση, όμως θα ήταν σφάλμα αν δεν αξιοποιούσαμε τους δικούς μας φυσικούς πόρους, όπως κάνει ήδη η Κύπρος”.

Στεγαστικό πρόγραμμα για τα στελέχη των Ενόπλων Δυνάμεων, με 10.454 νέες κατοικίες και εκσυγχρονισμό 7.030 υφιστάμενων, παρουσίασε ο Νίκος Δένδιας.
Το νέο οικιστικό πρόγραμμα των Ενόπλων Δυνάμεων περιλαμβάνει την κατασκευή 10.454 νέων κατοικιών και τον εκσυχρονισμό των υφιστάμενων 7.030 κατοικιών ώστε συνολικά σε βάθος 15ετίας να υπάρχουν 17.484 σύγχρονες κατοικίες για τα στελέχη . Αυτό ανέφερε σήμερα, Τέταρτη 12 Νοεμβρίου, ο υπουργός Εθνικής Άμυνας, Νίκος Δένδιας, σε παρουσίαση που πραγματοποιήθηκε στο υπουργείο Εθνικής Άμυνας.
Ο κ. Δένδιας, μεταξύ άλλων, σημείωσε ότι «η χρηματοδότηση θα γίνει από ίδιους πόρους» ενώ, όπως τόνισε το πρόγραμμα διέπεται από «διακλαδικότητα και διαφάνεια» .
«Στόχος» , είπε, «είναι να υπάρξει παροχή στέγης σε όλα τα στελέχη των Ενόπλων Δυνάμεων που μετατίθενται σε τόπο μη επιθυμίας τους . Θεωρούμε ότι αυτό αποτελεί υποχρέωση της ελληνικής πολιτείας» .

Η κατασκευή περισσότερων από 10.454 νέων κατοικιών χωρίζεται σε τρεις φάσεις:
• Α’ Φάση: Κατασκευή περισσότερων από 5.100 για το σύνολο του προσωπικού σε Έβρο και νησιά του Ανατολικού Αιγαίου για την περίοδο έως 2030. Η πρώτη φάση ξεκίνησε το 2024 και έως τον Δεκέμβριο του 2026 θα παραδοθούν περισσότερες από 1.059 κατοικίες.
• Β’ Φάση: Κατασκευή περισσότερων από 2.623 κατοικιών για το σύνολο του προσωπικού σε Αιγαίο, Κρήτη και Θράκη και το 50% της Αττικής για την περίοδο 2031-2035.
• Γ’ Φάση: Κατασκευή περισσότερων από 2.731 κατοικιών στο 100% της επικράτειας έως το 2040.

Αντίστοιχα, ο εκσυγχρονισμός 7.030 υφιστάμενων στρατιωτικών οικημάτων χωρίζεται σε τρεις φάσεις:
• Α’ Φάση: Ανακαίνιση – συντήρηση  2.520 κατοικιών έως το 2030 σε Θράκη, νησιά Αιγαίου και 50% Κρήτη.
• Β’ Φάση: Ανακαίνιση – συντήρηση 2.527 κατοικιών σε Μακεδονία, Αττική και 50% Κρήτη, από το 2031-2035.
• Γ’ Φάση: Ανακαίνιση – συντήρηση 1.983 κατοικιών στην υπόλοιπη επικράτεια για την περίοδο 2036-2040.
«Παράλληλα με τις νέες κατοικίες» , επεσήμανε ο κ. Δένδιας, «θα γίνει ο εκσυγχρονισμός των 7.030 υφιστάμενων κατοικιών των Ενόπλων Δυνάμεων».
Η χρηματοδότηση του Οικιστικού Προγράμματος είναι πλήρως εξασφαλισμένη . Αναλυτικά, οι πόροι που απαιτούνται φτάνουν τα 1,7 δισεκατομμύρια ευρώ εκ των οποίων τα 1,44 δισεκατομμύρια προέρχονται από ίδιους πόρους, ενώ τα 260 εκατομμύρια ευρώ προέρχονται από πόρους του υπουργείου Κοινωνικής Συνοχής και το Πρόγραμμα Δημοσίων Επενδύσεων.
Αναφορικά με το ποσό που θα προέλθει από ίδιους πόρους του υπουργείου, τα 1,27 δισεκατομμύρια θα χρηματοδοτήσουν νέες κατασκευές, τα 120 εκατομμύρια συντηρήσεις και ανακαινίσεις υφιστάμενων δομών ενώ τα 50 εκατομμύρια ευρώ νέες κοινωνικές δομές και συντηρήσεις.
Ο κ. Δένδιας έδωσε έμφαση στο γεγονός ότι για λόγους διαφάνειας θα ακολουθηθεί διαδικασία «τυποποίησης για συγκράτηση κόστους » στις νέες κατασκευές και τις ανακαινίσεις ενώ προχώρησε και στην παρουσίαση υποδειγμάτων συγκροτημάτων που θα περιλαμβάνουν οικίες του ενός, δύο και τριών υπνοδωματίων.
Ειδικότερα, για τις νέες δομές υπογράμμισε ότι θα κατασκευαστούν έξι νέοι βρεφονηπιακοί σταθμοί με δυνατότητα φιλοξενίας 252 βρεφών και νηπίων , ώστε να καλυφθούν στο 100% οι ανάγκες των στελεχών. Επίσης, ανακατασκευάζονται – επεκτείνονται 6 κτίρια υφιστάμενων παιδικών σταθμών για τη φιλοξενία 70 βρεφών πλέον των 180 νηπίων.
Ακόμη, θα κατασκευαστούν τρία νέα συγκροτήματα υποστήριξης διαβίωσης αποστράτων Ενόπλων Δυνάμεων , 50 διαμερίσματα του ενός υπνοδωματίου ενώ θα παρέχεται και ιατροφαρμακευτική υποστήριξη.
Ο υπουργός Εθνικής Άμυνας επανέλαβε ότι αποτελεί προτεραιότητα η «βελτίωση των συνθηκών διαβίωσης των στελεχών των Ενόπλων Δυνάμεων» αλλά και των ηλικιωμένων απόστρατων.
Επιπλέον, όπως εξήγγειλε, για δόκιμους αξιωματικούς που σπουδάζουν σε ΑΕΙ κατασκευάζονται 4 νέα συγκροτήματα φοιτητικών εστιών που θα φιλοξενούν 120 σπουδαστές, οι οποίοι μετέχουν στα Ειδικά Προγράμματα Θητείας.
Επιπρόσθετα, ο κ. Δένδιας εξήγγειλε πρωτοβουλία στήριξης του οικογενειακού καλαθιού για τις στρατιωτικές οικογένειες .
Συγκεκριμένα, μεσοσταθμικά το όφελος θα φτάσει το 20% με 23% σε σχέση με τις τιμές της αγοράς στα σούπερ μάρκετ .
Όπως ξεκαθάρισε, «όλες οι μονάδες και τα στρατιωτικά πρατήρια θα προμηθεύονται κεντρικά για μείωση κόστους» .
Θα υπαχθούν συνολικά 26 πρατήρια του Στρατού Ξηράς και 5 του Πολεμικού Ναυτικού όπου οι στρατιωτικές οικογένειες θα μπορούν να προμηθεύονται φθηνότερα προϊόντα.
«Έχουμε μια ολιστική προσέγγιση για τα στελέχη, που περιλαμβάνει καλύτερους μισθούς, καλύτερες συνθήκες με οριοθετημένη καριέρα για τα στελέχη, δωρεάν στέγη, φτηνό σούπερ μάρκετ, φροντίδα για τα παιδιά, καλό σύστημα υγείας από τα στρατιωτικά νοσοκομεία αλλά και φροντίδα για τους ηλικιωμένους απόστρατους», ανέλυσε ο υπουργός.
Με αυτόν τον τρόπο, όπως ανέφερε, «αποδεικνύουμε το ενδιαφέρον της Πολιτείας και της κοινωνίας για τα στελέχη των Ενόπλων Δυνάμεων» .
«Χρειαζόμαστε στις Ένοπλες Δυνάμεις τους καλύτερους από τους Έλληνες», κατέληξε ο κ. Δένδιας.

Ο 2ος κύκλος του προγράμματος στοχεύει στην εκπαίδευση 1.000 εκπαιδευτικών, όλων των ειδικοτήτων πρωτοβάθμιας και δευτεροβάθμιας εκπαίδευσης ανά την Ελλάδα.

Ο 2ος κύκλος του προγράμματος στοχεύει στην εκπαίδευση 1.000 εκπαιδευτικών, όλων των ειδικοτήτων πρωτοβάθμιας και δευτεροβάθμιας εκπαίδευσης ανά την Ελλάδα.
Η Τράπεζα Πειραιώς, στο πλαίσιο του προγράμματος Εταιρικής της Υπευθυνότητας « EQUALL – Για μια Κοινωνία Ισότιμων Ανθρώπων » και τον πυλώνα της Νέας Γενιάς, υποστηρίζει για δεύτερη συνεχή χρονιά, το καινοτόμο διαδραστικό πρόγραμμα επιμόρφωσης εκπαιδευτικών « GenAI Empowered Educators » που υλοποιείται από τον οργανισμό The Tipping Point σε συνεργασία με το Ινστιτούτο Εκπαιδευτικής Πολιτικής (ΙΕΠ).
Το πρόγραμμα ξεκίνησε κατά το σχολικό έτος 2024-2025 με τη συμμετοχή 535 εκπαιδευτικών 37 διαφορετικών ειδικοτήτων και υλοποιήθηκε με μεγάλη επιτυχία και ενδιαφέρον από την εκπαιδευτική κοινότητα.
Ο 2ος κύκλος του προγράμματος στοχεύει στην εκπαίδευση 1.000 εκπαιδευτικών, όλων των ειδικοτήτων πρωτοβάθμιας και δευτεροβάθμιας εκπαίδευσης ανά την Ελλάδ α. Η επιμόρφωση έχει σχεδιαστεί, ώστε να προσφέρει απαραίτητες δεξιότητες και γνώσεις για την κατανόηση των τεχνολογιών Παραγωγικής Τεχνητής Νοημοσύνης (GenΑΙ).
Ο συνδυασμός θεωρητικής κατάρτισης (learning by studying) και πρακτικής εξάσκησης (learning by doing) προετοιμάζει τους/τις εκπαιδευτικούς να μετατρέψουν την εξειδικευμένη γνώση που λαμβάνουν σε απτά αποτελέσματα, με βάση τις ανάγκες της ειδικότητάς τους. Συγκεκριμένα, οι εκπαιδευτικοί εξασκούνται σε ρεαλιστικά σενάρια μέσω ειδικά προσαρμοσμένης ψηφιακής πλατφόρμας που συνδυάζει την GenAI με την ανθρώπινη γνώση και εμπειρία.
Από τον 1ο κύκλο, αναδείχτηκε ο ρόλος των εκπαιδευτικών ως ο συνδετικός κρίκος μεταξύ της τεχνολογικής εξέλιξης και της μάθησης. Με την ολοκλήρωση της επιμόρφωσης, διπλασιάστηκε η χρήση GenAI εργαλείων στην τάξη με περισσότερους/ες από το 95% των εκπαιδευτικών να δηλώνουν πιο έτοιμοι/ες να συμβάλλουν στη δημιουργία μιας υγιούς σχέσης μεταξύ της νέας γενιάς και της GenAI.
Οι ενδιαφερόμενοι/ες εκπαιδευτικοί μπορούν να ενημερωθούν και να δηλώσουν συμμετοχή στο πρόγραμμα « GenAI Empowered Educators » ηλεκτρονικά. Οι αιτήσεις συμμετοχής θα ανοίξουν την Τρίτη, 18 Νοεμβρίου, στις 16:00 και θα υποβάλλονται μέσω σχετικής φόρμας στην ιστοσελίδα του προγράμματος.
Η περίοδος υποβολής αιτήσεων λήγει την Παρασκευή, 21 Νοεμβρίου, στις 16:00. Οι θέσεις είναι περιορισμένες και θα τηρηθεί σειρά προτεραιότητας, βάσει της αίτησης συμμετοχής.

Ο Αλέξης Χαρίτσης τόνισε γιατί θεωρεί πολύ σημαντική την προσφυγή στη βάση του κόμματος παρά την αντίθετη άποψη της Κεντρικής Επιτροπής.
Με νέα δήλωσή του το απόγευμα της Τετάρτης ο Αλέξης Χαρίτσης ξαναφέρει στο προσκήνιο την πρότασή του για προσφυγή στα μέλη του κόμματος για το ζήτημα των συνεργασιών.
Ο επικεφαλής της Νέας Αριστεράς αναφέρει χαρακτηριστικά ένα κομματικό παρελθόν που παλαιότερα μας ταλάνισε να μην οδηγεί στο συγκεντρωτισμό και αναγνώρισε ότι η πλειοψφία της Κεντρικής Επιτροπής διαφωνεί με τη δική του συλλογιστική.
Παρόλα αυτά επιμένει γιατί, όπως ο ίδιος τονίζει, “αποτελεί ζήτημα πολιτικής εντιμότητας και κομματικής δημοκρατίας”.
Υπενθυμίζουμε ότι σύμφωνα με το καταστατικό της Νέας Αριστεράς αν μία πρόταση συγκεντρώσει τις υπογραφές του 25% των μελών του κόμματος, μπορεί να υιοθετηθεί αυτομάτως.
Στην Αριστερά, ιστορικά, υπάρχουν δύο αποκλίνουσες προσεγγίσεις για το ποια πρέπει να είναι η στάση της σε στιγμές κρίσης.
Η πρώτη επιμένει στη λογική της αυτόνομης πορείας και σε έναν σκληρό πυρήνα ιδεολογικών και πολιτικών αναφορών. Κατά κανόνα, είναι μια στάση περιχαράκωσης και αναδίπλωσης στο όνομα των αντίξοων συνθηκών.
Η δεύτερη αναζητεί τη διέξοδο σε μέτωπα με όμορες ιδεολογικά κοινωνικές και πολιτικές δυνάμεις. Κατά κανόνα, είναι μια στάση που προκύπτει από τη λογική του κατεπείγοντος. Αυτά που μας ενώνουν, είναι περισσότερα από αυτά που μας χωρίζουν.
Αυτές οι δύο γραμμές βρίσκονται σε διάλογο, συγκρούονται και συντίθενται. Αλλά σε κάθε στροφή, μία είναι αυτή που δίνει τον τόνο.
Είναι γνωστό ότι στη Νέα Αριστερά υπάρχουν διαφορετικές απόψεις για το πώς οφείλουμε να κινηθούμε από εδώ και πέρα. Και αυτό είναι απολύτως λογικό και θεμιτό.
Τη δική μου θέση την έχω διατυπώσει ρητά και ανοιχτά. Δεν είναι μόνο προσωπική θέση. Είναι η θέση του ιδρυτικού συνεδρίου της Νέας Αριστεράς : Λαϊκό Μέτωπο με κοινό πρόγραμμα απέναντι στο καθεστώς Μητσοτάκη και στην άνοδο της ακροδεξιάς.
Πιστεύω ακράδαντα ότι αυτή η θέση επικοινωνεί με το βασικό αίτημα των αριστερών και προοδευτικών πολιτών στην Ελλάδα του 2025.
Και πιστεύω, επίσης, ότι εκφράζει και την πλειοψηφία των οργανωμένων μελών της Νέας Αριστεράς .
Ίσως κάνω λάθος. Όμως αυτό είναι κάτι που πρέπει να το διαπιστώσουμε: τι πιστεύουν οι άνθρωποι που παλεύουν για την Νέα Αριστερά.
Το θεωρώ ζήτημα πολιτικής εντιμότητας και κομματικής δημοκρατίας.
Βρισκόμαστε σε μια στιγμή που το κοινωνικό αίτημα είναι η ενότητα των δυνάμεων της πληθυντικής Αριστεράς και του προοδευτικού χώρου συνολικότερα.
Και μόνο μέσα από έναν ευρύ πόλο συσπείρωσης δυνάμεων που θα αντιπαρατεθεί πειστικά με τη Δεξιά, θα μπορέσουν να εκφραστούν και τα πιο δυναμικά, τα πιο ζωντανά στρώματα της ελληνικής κοινωνίας. Όλοι εκείνοι και εκείνες που ασφυκτιούν και αναζητούν διέξοδο, που επιδιώκουν την πολιτική αλλαγή. Οι άνθρωποι κινητοποιούνται και παίρνουν την υπόθεση στα χέρια τους όταν νιώθουν ότι εμφανίζεται μια δύναμη που εκφράζει τα υλικά τους συμφέροντα, επικοινωνεί με τις ιδέες τους, συνδέεται με αιτήματα που συμπυκνώνουν τα μεγάλα διακυβεύματα της εποχής μας και μπορεί να αλλάξει τους συσχετισμούς.
Γι’ αυτό και θεωρώ ότι αυτό που έχει σημασία σήμερα είναι η ενότητα και η ανασυγκρότηση. Με αυτό που λείπει: αιχμές. Εντός αυτού του πόλου προφανώς θα υπάρχουν διαφορετικές απόψεις, τάσεις και ρεύματα. Και εκεί θέλω να δω την Νέα Αριστερά.
Γιατί η Νέα Αριστερά μπορεί να έχει πρωταγωνιστικό ρόλο στην υπόθεση αυτή.
Γιατί έχει προωθημένες προγραμματικές θέσεις.
Γιατί έχει την έγνοια της εφαρμογής της αριστερής πολιτικής στο σήμερα. Στα μεγάλα επίδικα της εποχής μας, στα καθημερινά προβλήματα και τις αγωνίες της κοινωνίας.
Και γι’ αυτό θεωρώ ότι τα μέλη της Νέας Αριστεράς πρέπει να έχουν τη δυνατότητα να εκφράσουν την άποψή τους.
Η πλειοψηφία της Κεντρικής Επιτροπής διαφωνεί.
Ακούω την πολιτική διαφωνία.
Δεν συμφωνώ, αλλά την ακούω.
Νιώθω όμως ότι δεν πρέπει ένα κομματικό παρελθόν που παλαιότερα μας ταλάνισε, γιατί κομματικές δομές αφέθηκαν να μη δουλεύουν, να λειτουργεί τόσο τραυματικά ακόμα ώστε να μας οδηγεί στην αμφισβήτηση της ανοιχτότητας , στην άρνηση της δημοκρατικής συζήτησης, στον συγκεντρωτισμό, στην αυτάρκεια των δομών που δεν ανασαίνουν.
Να ανοίξουμε λοιπόν τη συζήτηση.
Σε τελευταία ανάλυση, σε αυτή την κρίσιμη συγκυρία, την πορεία των πραγμάτων στο κόμμα μας και ευρύτερα στον αριστερό χώρο δεν μπορεί παρά να την καθορίσει η βάση του κόμματος και ο κόσμος της Αριστεράς .

Σε άτυπη ενημέρωση που πραγματοποιήθηκε για θέματα που σχετίζονται με την αγροτική πολιτική, πηγές της Κομισιόν αναφέρθηκαν και στο σκάνδαλο του ΟΠΕΚΕΠΕ
Στο σκάνδαλο του ΟΠΕΚΕΠΕ αναφέρθηκαν μεταξύ άλλων αξιωματούχοι της Κομισιόν, σε άτυπη ενημέρωση της Επιτροπής για θέματα που σχετίζονται με την αγροτική πολιτική.
Σύμφωνα με την ΕΡΤ , πηγές της Κομισιόν αναφέρθηκαν στην Ελλάδα, σημειώνοντας πως αυτό που επιθυμούν είναι να φτάσουν τα χρήματα στους αγρότες που το δικαιούνται.
Οι αξιωματούχοι είπαν χαρακτηριστικά ότι «δεν θέλουμε να τιμωρήσουμε την Ελλάδα. Θέλουμε τα χρήματα να φτάνουν στους αγρότες που τα δικαιούνται».
«Η καθυστέρηση στην καταβολή των χρημάτων οφείλεται σε μια διαδικασία που ουσιαστικά η χώρα μας πρέπει να καταβάλει τα χρήματα και στη συνέχεια να γίνει η αποζημίωση» είπαν στη συνέχεια.
Οι αξιωματούχοι προσέθεσαν ότι υπάρχει μία διαδικασία που αυτή τη στιγμή θα πρέπει να ελέγξει η ελληνική πλευρά πιο προσεκτικά αυτά τα ποσά.
Παράλληλα, η Ευρωπαϊκή Επιτροπή θα επισπεύσει δυο πολύ κρίσιμες διαδικασίες και συγκεκριμένα όπως έγινε γνωστό από τους αξιωματούχους, την έγκριση του επικαιροποιημένου σχεδίου δράσης που αφορά το ζήτημα ροής των πληρωμών που κατατέθηκε πριν από λίγες ημέρες και αναμένεται, εφόσον όλα πάνε καλά , η έγκριση να γίνει πριν τα Χριστούγεννα , ενώ το δεύτερο κομμάτι αφορά την ενσωμάτωση του ΟΠΕΚΕΠΕ στην ΑΑΔΕ που αρχικά θα είχε ολοκληρωθεί μέχρι το τέλος Ιουνίου.
Σύμφωνα με την Κομισιόν, με την ολοκλήρωση του ελέγχου θα επισπεύσει τη διαδικασία με στόχο να ολοκληρωθεί ως τα μέσα Μαρτίου.
Η Κομισιόν αναφέρθηκε και στον τρόπο των πληρωμών, αλλά και για έρευνες που συνεχίζονται σε άλλες 10 χώρες.

Ανάρτηση του πρωθυπουργού στο TikTok για το μέτρο του μηδενισμού του φόρου εισοδήματος για τους νέους έως 25 ετών με εισόδημα έως 20.000 ευρώ
“Οι νέοι δε στηρίζονται με λόγια αλλά με πράξεις , γιατί σας θέλουμε πρωταγωνιστές σε μία Ελλάδα που αλλάζει”, υπογραμμίζει σε ανάρτηση του στα μέσα κοινωνικής δικτύωσης και συγκεκριμένα στην πλατφόρμα του Tik tok ο πρωθυπουργός, Κυριάκος Μητσοτάκης, ο οποίος υπενθυμίζει το μέτρο του μηδενισμού του φόρου εισοδήματος για τους νέους έως 25 ετών με εισόδημα έως 20.000 ευρώ, που ανακοίνωσε από το βήμα της ΔΕΘ στις αρχές του περασμένου Σεπτεμβρίου.
Μάλιστα, στην ίδια ανάρτηση ο Κυριάκος Μητσοτάκης επικαλέστηκε το παράδειγμα νέου με καθαρό εισόδημα 980 ευρώ. “Από 1η Ιανουαρίου ο καθαρός μισθός του θα αυξηθεί κατά 91 ευρώ και θα πάει στα 1071 ευρώ, δηλαδή σε ετήσια βάση η αύξηση θα είναι 1.300 ευρώ, δηλαδή πάνω από ένα μισθό τον χρόνο”, σημείωσε χαρακτηριστικά ο πρωθυπουργός.

Κατά τη διάρκεια της επίσκεψής του στο εργοστάσιο Ελληνικά Καλώδια στην Κόρινθο, ο κ. Χατζηδάκης ξεναγήθηκε στους σύγχρονους χώρους παραγωγής από τον Διευθύνοντα Σύμβουλο και μέλος του Διοικητικού Συμβουλίου της Βιοχάλκο, κ. Ιωάννη Στασινόπουλο.
Με αφορμή την ολοκλήρωση των νέων μονάδων στο εργοστάσιο Ελληνικά Καλώδια στην Κόρινθο, ο αντιπρόεδρος της κυβέρνησης, Κωστής Χατζηδάκης επισκέφθηκε τις εγκαταστάσεις της εταιρείας. Κατά τη διάρκεια της επίσκεψής του, ο κ. Χατζηδάκης ξεναγήθηκε στους σύγχρονους χώρους παραγωγής, από τον διευθύνοντα σύμβουλο και μέλος του Διοικητικού Συμβουλίου της Βιοχάλκο, Ιωάννη Στασινόπουλο, και τον διευθύνοντα σύμβουλο της Cenergy Holdings, Αλέξη Αλεξίου. Παράλληλα, είχε την ευκαιρία να ενημερωθεί αναλυτικά για τη λειτουργία, τις πρόσφατες επενδύσεις και τις εξαγωγικές δραστηριότητες της εταιρείας.
Μετά την ολοκλήρωση της επίσκεψής του, ο κ. Χατζηδάκης σε ανάρτησή του στα μέσα κοινωνικής δικτύωσης ανέφερε τα εξής: « Οι Έλληνες είμαστε πρωταθλητές ακόμα και σε τομείς που δεν φανταζόμαστε ούτε εμείς οι ίδιοι ! Υπάρχουν ελληνικές βιομηχανίες που θα τις ζήλευαν ακόμα και οι πιο προηγμένες χώρες του κόσμου! Μια από αυτές είναι η εταιρεία Ελληνικά Καλώδια στην Κόρινθο, την οποία επισκέφτηκα σήμερα. Πρόκειται για μια δυναμική και καινοτόμα επιχείρηση, η οποία παράγει και εξάγει πολύ προηγμένα τεχνολογικά, ενεργειακά και τηλεπικοινωνιακά, καλώδια. Και συμμετέχει σε ιδιαίτερα απαιτητικά ενεργειακά πρότζεκτς στην Ελλάδα, αλλά και διεθνώς». Ένα από αυτά, συνέχισε, ήταν «η ηλεκτρική διασύνδεση Πελοποννήσου – Κρήτης, για την οποία κατασκεύασε το υποβρύχιο καλώδιο εναλλασσόμενου ρεύματος. Η εταιρεία επέκτεινε πρόσφατα τις εγκαταστάσεις της, με ιδιαίτερα σύγχρονα μηχανήματα και πολλές νέες προσλήψεις προσωπικού. Ενώ συνολικά στο εργοστάσιο αυτό εργάζονται 1.200 άτομα».
Συνολικά δε, «τα τελευταία χρόνια, η βιομηχανική δραστηριότητα και οι εξαγωγές της βιομηχανίας αυξάνονται. Ενώ έχουν δημιουργηθεί και 60.000 νέες θέσεις εργασίας . Όλα αυτά είναι αποτέλεσμα προφανώς της σημαντικής προσπάθειας που κάνουν οι επιχειρηματίες και οι εργαζόμενοι τους, αλλά την ίδια στιγμή είναι και αποτέλεσμα της φιλοεπενδυτικής πολιτικής της κυβέρνησης. Με αυτό το σκεπτικό, επεξεργαζόμαστε μια παρέμβαση, όπως έχει ανακοινώσει ήδη ο Πρωθυπουργός, για τη μείωση του ενεργειακού κόστους για τις βιομηχανίες, με έμφαση στις ενεργοβόρες, που θα στηρίξει τη δραστηριότητά τους και διαφυλάξει τις θέσεις εργασίας τους. Η ελληνική βιομηχανία είναι όρθια και τη στηρίζουμε στην πράξη», υπογράμμισε κλείνοντας ο αντιπρόεδρος της κυβέρνησης.

Title       : Έρευνα ΟΟΣΑ: Το 71% των επιχειρήσεων στην Ελλάδα δυσκολεύεται στην εύρεση προσωπικού

Οι ελληνικές επιχειρήσεις δυσκολεύονται ολοένα και περισσότερο να βρουν προσωπικό ενώ οι ελλείψεις εργατικού δυναμικού αυξάνονται, σύμφωνα με έρευνα του ΟΟΣΑ. “Κλειδί” η ενσωμάτωση των μεταναστών.
Οι ελλείψεις εργατικού δυναμικού στην Ελλάδα αυξάνονται, η αγορά εργασίας «στενεύει», μετά την πανδημία και οι επιχειρήσεις δυσκολεύονται ολοένα περισσότερο να βρουν προσωπικό, σύμφωνα με όσα αναφέρθηκαν στο πλαίσιο του 2ου Ετήσιου Συνεδρίου του Κέντρου Κρήτης του ΟΟΣΑ για τη Δυναμική των Πληθυσμών.
Κατά τη διάρκεια της τοποθέτησής του, ο οικονομολόγος του ΟΟΣΑ, Cem Özgüzel, παρουσίασε μελέτη για τις ελλείψεις δεξιοτήτων και τις αναντιστοιχίες στην ελληνική αγορά.
Όπως σημείωσε, το έργο του ΟΟΣΑ στοχεύει στην κατανόηση των αιτιών που προκαλούν τις ελλείψεις, στην εμπειρική εξέταση της συμβολής της μετανάστευσης και στην ανάδειξη πολιτικών επιλογών για τη βελτίωση της ισορροπίας μεταξύ προσφοράς και ζήτησης εργασίας, ενώ τόνισε ότι τα νέα στοιχεία αναδεικνύουν τον ρόλο της μετανάστευσης ως κρίσιμου παράγοντα για την ενίσχυση της απασχόλησης και την κάλυψη των κενών θέσεων εργασίας.
Σύμφωνα με τα ευρήματα της μελέτης, « το 71% των επιχειρήσεων στην Ελλάδα δηλώνει δυσκολία στην εξεύρεση προσωπικού , ποσοστό χαμηλότερο από τον μέσο όρο του ΟΟΣΑ, αλλά σταθερά υψηλό. Η “στενότητα” της αγοράς έχει αυξηθεί ραγδαία, μετά το 2020, ενώ το ποσοστό μεταναστών στη χώρα (11%) υπολείπεται του μέσου όρου των χωρών του ΟΟΣΑ (15%). Οι περισσότεροι μετανάστες διαθέτουν χαμηλότερο επίπεδο εκπαίδευσης από τους ντόπιους (26% έναντι 42%) και εργάζονται κυρίως σε χαμηλής ειδίκευσης επαγγέλματα, όπως η γεωργία, οι κατασκευές και οι υπηρεσίες. Ωστόσο, σχεδόν οι μισοί (45%) απασχολούνται σε θέσεις κάτω των προσόντων τους ».
Ο κ. Özgüzel υπογράμμισε ότι προτεραιότητα της πολιτικής πρέπει να είναι η καλύτερη αντιστοίχιση δεξιοτήτων με τις ανάγκες της αγοράς, η ταχύτερη αναγνώριση επαγγελματικών προσόντων και η αξιοποίηση του ταλέντου των μεταναστών για τη βιώσιμη αντιμετώπιση των ελλείψεων εργατικού δυναμικού.
Η οικονομολόγος του ΟΟΣΑ, Lisa Andersson, δήλωσε ότι οι μετανάστες μπορούν να διαδραματίσουν καθοριστικό ρόλο στην κάλυψη των κενών θέσεων, σημειώνοντας όμως ότι η αύξηση της μετανάστευσης από μόνη της δεν αποτελεί λύση. Όπως είπε, απαιτούνται αποτελεσματικές πολιτικές ένταξης, καθώς πολλοί μετανάστες διαθέτουν εξειδίκευση, αλλά αναγκάζονται να εργάζονται σε θέσεις χαμηλότερης ειδίκευσης.
Στο σημείο αυτό, πρότεινε μια πιο στοχευμένη διαχείριση του μεταναστευτικού δυναμικού, με χαρτογράφηση των αναγκών κάθε χώρας και σύνδεση με τις χώρες προέλευσης.
Η καθηγήτρια Πολιτικής Οικονομίας του Πανεπιστημίου του Τορίνο, Alessandra Venturini , τόνισε ότι η κοινή γνώμη και τα μέσα ενημέρωσης επικεντρώνονται σχεδόν αποκλειστικά στους αιτούντες άσυλο, που αντιστοιχούν σε μικρό ποσοστό των μεταναστευτικών ροών. Σύμφωνα με την ίδια, «η μετανάστευση πρέπει να αντιμετωπίζεται όχι μόνο ανθρωπιστικά, αλλά και αναπτυξιακά, μέσα από πολιτικές που συνδέουν την κοινωνική ένταξη με τις ανάγκες της αγοράς εργασίας» .
Ανέδειξε μάλιστα τη σημασία της γλωσσικής εκπαίδευσης και της κατανόησης της κουλτούρας της χώρας υποδοχής, επισημαίνοντας ότι η αφομοίωση δεν λειτουργεί, ενώ η ουσιαστική ενσωμάτωση είναι κρίσιμη για τη συνοχή των κοινωνιών.
Από την πλευρά του, ο κ. Özgüzel ανέφερε ότι στην Ελλάδα εργάζεται το 60% των γυναικών και το 80% των ανδρών , γεγονός που δείχνει ότι υπάρχει σημαντικό περιθώριο αύξησης της συμμετοχής των γυναικών -και ειδικά των μεταναστριών- στην αγορά εργασίας. Όπως υποστήριξε, η ενεργός συμμετοχή τους μπορεί να συμβάλει ουσιαστικά στην αντιμετώπιση των ελλείψεων που προκαλούνται από τα δημογραφικά προβλήματα.
«Στην ισπανική εμπειρία, όπου το 20% του πληθυσμού είναι αλλοδαποί», αναφέρθηκε η καθηγήτρια Maite Alguacil , επιστημονική σύμβουλος του ισπανικού Υπουργείου Ένταξης, Κοινωνικής Ασφάλισης και Μετανάστευσης. Μίλησε για τη μεταρρύθμιση «που νομιμοποίησε χιλιάδες μετανάστες που βρίσκονταν ήδη εκεί και διευκόλυνε την κοινωνική τους ένταξη» , σημειώνοντας ότι η Ισπανία, με χαμηλά ποσοστά γεννήσεων, αντιμετωπίζει ήδη προκλήσεις στο ασφαλιστικό σύστημα και επιδιώκει να αξιοποιήσει τη μετανάστευση ως παράγοντα βιωσιμότητας και κοινωνικής συνοχής. Τόνισε δε ότι οι περισσότεροι μετανάστες στην Ισπανία προέρχονται από τη Λατινική Αμερική και ενσωματώνονται πλήρως στην ισπανική κοινωνία.
Τη συζήτηση συντόνισε ο επικεφαλής του Κέντρου Κρήτης του ΟΟΣΑ για τη Δυναμική των Πληθυσμών, Άρης Αλεξόπουλος.
Το Συνέδριο πραγματοποιείται στο Κέντρο Αρχιτεκτονικής Μεσογείου στα Χανιά, σε συνεργασία με τον Δήμο Χανίων και το Οικονομικό Φόρουμ των Δελφών, υπό την αιγίδα των Υπουργείων Εργασίας και Κοινωνικής Ασφάλισης, Μετανάστευσης και Ασύλου, Κοινωνικής Συνοχής και Οικογένειας και με την ευγενική υποστήριξη της Περιφέρειας Κρήτης και του Περιφερειακού Ταμείου Ανάπτυξης Κρήτης.

Με εμφάνιση-δήλωση ανωτερότητας, το Περιστέρι Betsson πέρασε σαν σίφουνας από τη Γεωργία, επικρατώντας άνετα κόντρα στην Κουταΐσι για την 5η αγωνιστική του FIBA Europe Cup.

Το Περιστέρι Betsson έδειξε από την αρχή ποιος είναι το αφεντικό στο παρκέ του Κουταΐσι και πήρε τη νίκη με 53-101 στη Γεωργία στην 5η αγωνιστική του Europe Cup.
Με ενέργεια, συγκέντρωση και εξαιρετική κυκλοφορία της μπάλας, οι κυανοκίτρινοι επέβαλαν τον ρυθμό τους από το πρώτο δεκάλεπτο, μη δίνοντας κανένα περιθώριο αντίδρασης στους γηπεδούχους.
Ο Καρντένας ήταν ο κινητήριος μοχλός της ομάδας, με διψήφιο αριθμό πόντων από το ξεκίνημα, αλλά και με τη βοήθεια του Τουμπεργκεν με 18 πόντους,  σε συνδυασμό με την άμυνα του Περιστερίου, η οποία περιόρισε αποτελεσματικά κάθε επιθετική προσπάθεια των γηπεδούχων.
Με συνεχείς εναλλαγές στην επίθεση και σκληρή δουλειά στα ριμπάουντ, το σύνολο του Ξανθόπουλου πήγε στα αποδυτήρια με διαφορά +25 στο ημίχρονο, μετατρέποντας ουσιαστικά το δεύτερο μέρος του παιχνιδιού διαδικαστικό.
Παρά την απουσία του Γιάνκοβιτς, το Περιστέρι έδειξε βάθος, ομοιογένεια και διάρκεια ενώ οι παίκτες που ήρθαν από τον πάγκο συνέχισαν με τον ίδιο ρυθμό, διατηρώντας τον απόλυτο έλεγχο του ματς μέχρι το φινάλε.
Η Κουταΐσι προσπάθησε κυρίως με τους Μπόικιν με 13 (2/3 δίποντα, 3/9 τρίποντα) και Αλαβίτζε 12 (4/7 δίποντα, 1/2 τρίποντα, 1/2 βολές), όμως δεν μπόρεσε να περιορίσει τον ρυθμό των Ελλήνων, που έπαιξαν με αυτοπεποίθηση και σοβαρότητα, γεγονός που το αποδεικνύει κυρίως η ανάλυση του δευτέρου δεκαλέπτου, στο οποίο η Κουταϊσι σκόραρε 7 πόντους σε σύγκριση με το Περιστέρι Betsson το οποίο έβαλε 26.
Με αυτή τη νίκη, η ελληνική ομάδα ανέβηκε στο 4-1, εξασφαλίζοντας τη 2η θέση του ομίλου και την πρόκριση στην επόμενη φάση του FIBA Europe Cup, αφού θα βρίσκεται ανάμεσα στις έξι καλύτερες δεύτερες των 10 ομίλων. Υπενθυμίζεται, ότι στον επόμενο γύρο προκρίνονται οι πρώτες ομάδες κάθε ομίλου και οι 6 καλύτερες δεύτερες. Αυτή τη στιγμή, το Περιστέρι με το ρεκόρ που έχει, είναι ο πρώτο ανάμεσα στις δεύτερες ομάδες των 10 γκρουπ.
Η ανασκόπηση του αγώνα:

Title       : Ο Ντέιβιντ Μπρουκς έγινε πατέρας τέσσερα χρόνια μετά τη μάχη του με τον καρκίνο – "Πίστευα ότι δεν θα μπορούσα ποτέ να αποκτήσω παιδί"

--- Summary ---
Μόλις τέσσερα χρόνια μετά τη συγκλονιστική του μάχη με τον καρκίνο, ο ποδοσφαιριστής της Μπόρνμουθ και της Εθνικής Ουαλίας, Ντέιβιντ Μπρουκς, κρατάει στην αγκαλιά του την κόρη του. Ο 28χρονος εξομολογήθηκε πως φοβόταν ότι η πατρότητα ίσως να μην ήταν ποτέ δυνατή μετά τη διάγνωσή του με λέμφωμα Hodgkin το 2021.

--- Full Text ---
Ο Ντέιβιντ Μπρουκς βιώνει μια από τις πιο ευτυχισμένες στιγμές της ζωής του, καθώς έγινε πατέρας. Ο 28χρονος Ουαλός μέσος της Μπόρνμουθ και η σύζυγός του, Φλόρα , υποδέχθηκαν στον κόσμο την κόρη τους, Λότι Ελίζαμπεθ Μπρουκς , στις 27 Οκτωβρίου.
Ο ποδοσφαιριστής ανακοίνωσε τα νέα με μια τρυφερή ανάρτηση στο Instagram, γράφοντας: “Η πανέμορφη κορούλα μας, Λότι Ελίζαμπεθ Μπρουκς, γεννήθηκε στις 27/10/25. Μια ξεχωριστή προσθήκη στην οικογένειά μας. @florabrooks_ σ’ αγαπώ”.
Η γέννηση της κόρης του αποκτά ακόμη μεγαλύτερη σημασία αν σκεφτεί κανείς τη μάχη που έδωσε ο Μπρουκς με τον καρκίνο πριν από λίγα χρόνια. Τον Οκτώβριο του 2021 διαγνώστηκε με λέμφωμα Hodgkin σταδίου 2, μια είδηση που άλλαξε τη ζωή του και τον ανάγκασε να μείνει μακριά από τα γήπεδα.
Σε δηλώσεις του το περασμένο καλοκαίρι, είχε παραδεχθεί ότι ο φόβος πως δεν θα μπορούσε ποτέ να γίνει πατέρας ήταν υπαρκτός: “Όταν διαγνώστηκα, οι γιατροί μου είπαν πως δεν υπήρχαν εγγυήσεις ότι θα μπορούσα να αποκτήσω παιδιά. Υπήρχε πιθανότητα να μην ήταν εφικτό. Νιώθω απίστευτα τυχερός που έγινε φυσιολογικά. Μετά τη θεραπεία, όλα επέστρεψαν στο φυσιολογικό”.
Ο Μπρουκς και η Φλόρα παντρεύτηκαν το καλοκαίρι του 2024, σε μια λαμπερή τελετή. Τον Ιούνιο του 2025, το ζευγάρι ανακοίνωσε πως περιμένει παιδί, δημοσιεύοντας μια φωτογραφία από το υπερηχογράφημα και μια τούρτα που έγραφε “Baby Brooks”, δίπλα σε μια φανέλα της Μπόρνμουθ με το όνομα “Daddy 7”.
Η ζωή του Μπρουκς , όμως, δεν ήταν πάντα τόσο φωτεινή. Λίγο πριν τη διάγνωσή του είχε παρατηρήσει δραματική απώλεια βάρους και έντονες νυχτερινές εφιδρώσεις. Οι γιατροί τον διέγνωσαν με καρκίνο και ξεκίνησε άμεσα χημειοθεραπείες που τον εξάντλησαν σωματικά και ψυχικά. “Υπήρχαν μέρες που δεν μπορούσα καν να σηκωθώ από το κρεβάτι”, είχε παραδεχθεί τότε.
Τον Μάιο του 2022 έλαβε τα χαρμόσυνα νέα ότι τα κατάφερε και το ξεπέρασε, επιστρέφοντας σταδιακά στις προπονήσεις και στη δράση. Από τότε έχει πραγματοποιήσει πάνω από 30 συμμετοχές με τη φανέλα της Μπόρνμουθ , ενώ φέτος μετρά ήδη επτά εμφανίσεις βασικού.
Ο Ουαλός άσος, που φιλοδοξεί να αγωνιστεί στο Παγκόσμιο Κύπελλο του 2026, απολαμβάνει τώρα μια νέα αρχή, όχι μόνο στα γήπεδα, αλλά και στη ζωή. Όπως είπε χαρακτηριστικά: “Πάντα ήθελα να κάνω οικογένεια. Δεν μπορούσα να το ελέγξω λόγω της ασθένειας, αλλά τώρα που έγινε φυσικά, νιώθω ευλογημένος. Ανυπομονώ για όσα έρχονται”.

Title       : Ατλέτικο: Υπογράφει νέο συμβόλαιο με τον γιο του Σιμεόνε, Τζουλιάνο, μέχρι το 2030

--- Summary ---
O Τζουλιάνο Σιμεόνε πραγματοποιεί εξαιρετικές εμφανίσεις με την Ατλέτικο και οι ροχιμπλάνκος είναι έτοιμοι να τον επιβραβεύσουν, προσφέροντας συμβόλαιο μέχρι το 20230 στον γιο του Ντιέγκο Σιμεόνε.

--- Full Text ---
Ο Ντιέγκο Σιμεόνε έχει πάρα πολλά πράγματα για τα οποία μπορεί να αισθάνεται υπερήφανος στα 14 χρόνια παρουσίας του στην Ατλέτικο και ένα από αυτά δεν θα μπορούσε να μην είναι το γεγονός πως προπονεί και τον γιο του Τζουλιάνο.
Ο 22χρονος επιθετικός έκανε τα πρώτα του βήματα στα τμήματα υποδομής των Μαδριλένων και αφού έκανε το “αγροτικό” του σε Σαραγόσα και Αλαβές, αγωνιζόμενος ως δανεικός, το καλοκαίρι του 2024 επέστρεψε στο “Μετροπολιτάνο”.
Αρχικά είχε το ρόλο του πέμπτου κατά σειρά στράικερ αλλά έφτασε να μετρήσει 26 ματς ως βασικός στην La Liga , με την απογείωσή του να έρχεται τη φετινή σεζόν όπου μέχρι στιγμής όχι απλά έχει αγωνιστεί σε όλα τα παιχνίδια πρωταθλήματος και Champions League αλλά μετράει 3 γκολ και 5 ασίστ σε 16 συμμετοχές.
Συν τοις άλλοις, ανακηρύχτηκε ο πολυτιμότερος παίκτης του αγώνα στα τρία τελευταία ραντεβού των κολτσονέρος, με την επιβράβευση να έρχεται άμεσα, καθώς σύμφωνα με το ρεπορτάζ του Ματέο Μορέτο επήλθε συμφωνία της διοίκησης με τον Τζουλιάνο Σιμεόνε για να υπογράψουν νέο συμβόλαιο με καλύτερους οικονομικούς όρους για τον παίκτη.
Αυτό θα έχει διάρκεια μέχρι το 2030, με τον Ισπανό δημοσιογράφο να αποκαλύπτει πως οι δύο πλευρές έδωσαν οριστικά τα χέρια και πως οι υπογραφές θα πέσουν σύντομα, είτε στα τέλη Νοεμβρίου είτε στις πρώτες ημέρες του Δεκεμβρίου.

Ο Γκάμπριελ Ντεκ μίλησε ενόψει του ματς Ρεάλ Μαδρίτης – Παναθηναϊκός, για την 11η αγωνιστική της EuroLeague.

--- Full Text ---
Η Ρεάλ Μαδρίτης θα αντιμετωπίσει στην Ισπανία τον Παναθηναϊκό, για την 11η αγωνιστική της EuroLeague, θέλοντας να επιστρέψει στις νίκες, μετά την ήττα της από τη Βαλένθια.
Ο Γκάμπριελ Ντεκ μίλησε ενόψει του ευρωπαϊκού ματς, με τον 30άχρονο φόργουορντ να στέκεται στη σκηράδα, αλλά και στη συγκέντρωσει που πρέπει να έχει η ομάδα του, ώστε να πάρει τη νίκη και να συνεχίσει την ανοδική της πορεία.
“Θα προσπαθήσουμε να κάνουμε το καλύτερο δυνατό απέναντι σε μια εξαιρετική ομάδα. Πρέπει να είμαστε συγκεντρωμένοι για 40 λεπτά, να παίξουμε σκληρά και να σκεφτόμαστε τους εαυτούς μας αν θέλουμε να πάρουμε τη νίκη.
Μας έλειψε λίγη σκληρότητα στη Βαλένθια. Επιθετικά, ο αντίπαλος μας έβγαλε εκτός παιχνιδιού κατά καιρούς με την επίθεσή του, και αυτό δεν μπορεί να συμβεί εναντίον του Παναθηναϊκού. Έχουμε ένα παιχνίδι για να εξιλεωθούμε. Θα είναι ένα πολύ απαιτητικό ματς. Ελπίζουμε να μπορέσουμε να τα πάμε καλά και να κάνουμε ένα σπουδαίο παιχνίδι στην έδρα μας.
Εξελισσόμαστε εβδομάδα με την εβδομάδα. Υπάρχουν πολλές νέες ιδέες και παίκτες που προσαρμόζονται. Είναι μια μεγάλη σεζόν και υπάρχουν πολλά παιχνίδια. Ας ελπίσουμε ότι θα συνεχίσουμε την ανοδική τάση και θα φτάσουμε στο τέλος της σεζόν ανταγωνιζόμενοι πολύ καλά.
Όσο για τη θέση μου, παίζω όπου θέλει ο Σκαριόλο. Προσπαθώ να συνεισφέρω και να βοηθήσω την ομάδα να κερδίζει παιχνίδια. Νιώθω καλά σωματικά και είμαι χαρούμενος που είμαι στην ομάδα. Μερικές φορές το τρίποντο μπαίνει και μερικές όχι, πρέπει να το παίρνεις χαλαρά”.

Ο Τζενάρο Γκατούζο αποκάλυψε την παραμονή του εκτός έδρας αγώνα με την Μολδαβία ότι οι Σκαμάκα και Ρασπαντόρι θα καλύψουν τη θέση των επιθετικών στην Ιταλία ενώ έκανε έντονα παράπονα για το σύστημα διεξαγωγής των προκριματικών του Παγκοσμίου Κυπέλλου.

--- Full Text ---
Η εθνική Ιταλίας μετράει αντίστροφα για τα δύο τελευταία ραντεβού της στα προκριματικά του Παγκοσμίου Κυπέλλου 2026 έχοντας να αντιμετωπίσει κατά σειρά τις Μολδαβία (13/11 εκτός) και Νορβηγία (16/11 εκτός), με τους ατζούρι να ξέρουν πως εκτός συγκλονιστικού απροόπτου θα πάρουν τη 2η θέση στον 9ο όμιλο και θα χρειαστεί να κυνηγήσουν την πρόκριση στα τελικά μέσω αγώνων playoffs.
Παραμονή του αγώνα στο Κινσινάου ο Τζενάρο Γκατούζο παραχώρησε συνέντευξη Τύπου, με τον τεχνικό της σκουάντρα ατζούρα να αποκαλύπτει το δίδυμο που θα εμφανιστεί στην επίθεση και να κάνει παράπονα για το σύστημα των προκριματικών στην ευρωπαϊκή ζώνη, που είναι εντελώς διαφορετικό από εκείνο στην Λατινική Αμερική.
“Οι Σκαμάκα και Ρασπαντόρι θα ξεκινήσουν. Ο Τζιανλούκα (Σκαμάκα) σίγουρα δεν έχει χρόνο συμμετοχής, αλλά ξέρουμε ότι όταν είναι σε φόρμα, μπορεί να μας δώσει πολλά. Πρέπει να παραμείνει ήρεμος και να παίξει σοβαρό παιχνίδι.
Δεν υπάρχει κάτι εύκολο, η Μολδαβία έχει αρκετούς ενδιαφέροντες παίκτες. Θα είμαι ειλικρινής, το μυαλό μου είναι επικεντρωμένο στον αγώνα της Πέμπτης και δεν μπορώ να σκεφτώ κάτι πέρα από αυτό.
Θα πρέπει να δείξουμε την πρόοδό μας στο γήπεδο και να δείξουμε ότι ξέρουμε να  υποφέρουμε. Τα παιδιά έδειξαν μεγάλο ζήλο στις προπονήσεις και αξίζουν συγχαρητήρια”, δήλωσε αρχικά ο “Ρίνγκιο”, για να ερωτηθεί στη συνέχεια για το αν έχει μετανιώσει για κάτι όσον αφορά στην παρουσία της Ιταλίας σε αυτή την προκριματική φάση και να εκφράζει παράπονα για το σύστημα των προκριματικών:
“Δεν έχω μετανιώσει για προηγούμενους αγώνες. Η νίκη σε βοηθά να κερδίζεις και πρέπει να παραμείνουμε συγκεντρωμένοι σε αυτό.
Το να παρακολουθούμε έναν προκριματικό γύρο όπως αυτόν της Νότιας Αμερικής, όπου οι έξι πρώτες ομάδες προκρίνονται και η έβδομη ομάδα προκρίνεται στα playoffs εναντίον των ομάδων της Ωκεανίας, μάς θυμώνει λίγο και μας κάνει να συνειδητοποιούμε πόσο περίπλοκη είναι η πορεία μας.
Το σύστημα προκριματικών του Παγκοσμίου Κυπέλλου πρέπει να αλλάξει”.

Η επίδειξη πραγματοποιήθηκε ενώ ο Παναθηναϊκός απουσίαζε λόγω των εκτός έδρας υποχρεώσεών του στο Παρίσι, όπου επικράτησε της γαλλικής ομάδας με 101-95 για τη EuroLeague, γεγονός που έδωσε την ευκαιρία να αξιοποιηθεί το γήπεδο για τη λαμπερή αυτή εκδήλωση.
Ο γνωστός Έλληνας σχεδιαστής Πάρης Βαλταδώρος παρουσίασε τη νέα του συλλογή στο γήπεδο του Παναθηναϊκού, προσφέροντας ένα εντυπωσιακό θέαμα που συνδύασε τη μόδα με την ενέργεια του αθλητισμού και συγκέντρωσε πλήθος κόσμου, ανάμεσά τους γνωστά πρόσωπα από τη μουσική και την τηλεόραση.

Όλοι απογοητεύτηκαν με τη νέα καθυστέρηση του GTA 6, αλλά μάλλον κανείς δεν το πήρε πιο σοβαρά από τους Πολωνούς βουλευτές.
Μετά την ανακοίνωση της Rockstar Games ότι το πολυαναμενόμενο παιχνίδι μετατίθεται για τις 19 Νοεμβρίου 2026, η είδηση έφτασε μέχρι τη βουλή της Πολωνίας. Εκεί, ο βουλευτής Witold Tumanowicz αποφάσισε να εκφράσει την αγανάκτησή του δημοσίως, μιλώντας για “ένα πολύ ανησυχητικό θέμα” και δήλωσε ότι:
Κυρία πρόεδρε, αξιότιμα μέλη, πριν από μία ώρα η Rockstar Games ανακοίνωσε ότι η κυκλοφορία του GTA 6 θα αναβληθεί μέχρι το επόμενο έτος. Πρόκειται για τεράστιο σκάνδαλο.
Αυτό προκάλεσε γέλια στο ακροατήριο και ο ίδιος συνέχισε, με ακόμα περισσότερο χιούμορ λέγοντας ότι:
Αν ο κόσμος δεν βγει στους δρόμους μετά από κάτι τέτοιο, δεν ξέρω τι θα γίνει!
Η τοποθέτησή του δεν έμεινε αναπάντητη, καθώς ο αντίπαλος βουλευτής Paweł Szrot απάντησε χαμογελώντας ότι:
Σέβομαι τέτοιες δηλώσεις, κύριε εκπρόσωπε.
Το στιγμιότυπο, φυσικά, έγινε αμέσως viral στα social media, με τους fans να γελούν που μέχρι και οι πολιτικοί συμμερίζονται τον “πόνο” της αναμονής, που πλέον απέκτησε και κοινοβουλευτική διάσταση.

Title       : Το πρώην αφεντικό της Nintendo Αμερικής “ξαφνιάστηκε” με το lineup παιχνιδιών του Switch 2

Το πρώην «αφεντικό» της Nintendo America, Reggie Fils-Aime, έδωσε μια νέα συνέντευξη στο The Game Business, κάνοντας ορισμένες δηλώσεις που σίγουρα θα συζητηθούν.
Όπως είπε, ξαφνιάστηκε με το αρχικό lineup παιχνιδιών του Switch 2, διότι μάλλον περίμενε την κονσόλα με κάποιο νέο 3D Mario (τύπου Super Mario Odyssey) ή κάποιο νέο Zelda.
Να σας υπενθυμίσουμε, ότι το Nintendo Switch 2 κυκλοφόρησε στις 5 Ιουνίου μαζί με το Mario Kart World, διάφορα third-party games, ενώ τον Ιούλιο έφτασε και το Donkey Kong Bananza. Πρόσφατα έγινε διαθέσιμο το Pokemon Legends: Z-A, το Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment, ενώ οι παίκτες θα πρέπει να περιμένουν το Kirby Air Riders και το Metroid Prime 4: Beyond.
Ο Fils-Aime είπε:
Από επιχειρηματικής πλευράς, όταν είδα για πρώτη φορά το lineup των τίτλων του Nintendo Switch 2, ξαφνιάστηκα λίγο.
Ο Fils-Aime επισήμανε επίσης ότι η Nintendo θα πρέπει να δώσει σε τρίτους developers τη δυνατότητα να αξιοποιήσουν πλήρως το hardware της, με τον ίδιο τρόπο που κάνει και εκείνη: όπως παραδείγματος χάρη που κατάφερε να χωρέσει τα τεράστια παιχνίδια της, όπως το Tears of the Kingdom, σε ένα τόσο δα μικρό cartridge, χάρη στη βαθιά γνώση που έχει για το μηχάνημά της.
Η Nintendo (πάντα κατά τη γνώμη μου) δεν πρόκειται ποτέ να τοποθετήσει τον εαυτό της ως άμεσο ανταγωνιστή του PlayStation. Δεν είναι στο DNA της αυτό. Το κλειδί της επιτυχίας είναι να διασφαλίσει ότι οι third-party developers διαθέτουν τα κατάλληλα εργαλεία για να φέρουν τα παιχνίδια τους στο Switch 2. Θα καλωσόριζαν με χαρά περιεχόμενο που απευθύνεται σε “core games”, όπως τα πιο πρόσφατα Assassin’s Creed ή το Call of Duty.
Τέλος, ο Fils-Aimé δηλώνει έκπληκτος που η Microsoft δεν έχει φέρει περισσότερα παιχνίδια στο Switch 2.
Είμαι έκπληκτος που το Xbox δεν έχει αγκαλιάσει ακόμα πλήρως το Switch 2, από πλευράς λογισμικού. Πολλά παιχνίδια του Xbox θα μπορούσαν να μεταφερθούν εύκολα στο Switch 2. Και με εκπλήσσει το γεγονός ότι δεν τα έχουμε δει ακόμα. Περίμενα να υπάρχει πολύ μεγαλύτερη δραστηριότητα από πλευράς Microsoft, ειδικά αυτή την περίοδο που πλησιάζουμε στις γιορτές.
Ο Reggie Fils-Aime αποχώρησε από την Nintendo το 2019. Δείτε ολόκληρη την συνέντευξη παρακάτω.

Title       : Η SEGA αυξάνει τους μισθούς στην Ιαπωνία για δεύτερη φορά μέσα σε τρία χρόνια

Η SEGA ετοιμάζεται να δώσει νέες αυξήσεις στους εργαζομένους της στην Ιαπωνία, τρία χρόνια μετά την τελευταία αναπροσαρμογή. Από την 1η Απριλίου 2026, οι βασικοί μισθοί θα αυξηθούν κατά περίπου 10%, σε μια προσπάθεια της εταιρείας να προσφέρει οικονομική σταθερότητα και να ανταποκριθεί στο αυξανόμενο κόστος ζωής στη χώρα.
Παράλληλα, ο αρχικός μισθός για νέους αποφοίτους ανεβαίνει στα περίπου $2.130 τον μήνα, ενισχύοντας το ενδιαφέρον για νέα ταλέντα. Η SEGA τονίζει ότι οι άνθρωποί της παραμένουν “η καρδιά της δημιουργίας” και πως οι αλλαγές αυτές είναι μέρος μιας συνολικής αναδιοργάνωσης που στοχεύει σε μεγαλύτερη ευελιξία και δημιουργικότητα στο εργασιακό περιβάλλον.
Πέρα από τις μισθολογικές αυξήσεις, η εταιρεία συνεχίζει τα προγράμματα Fami+ και Job+, τα οποία βοηθούν τους εργαζομένους να συνδυάζουν οικογενειακές υποχρεώσεις ή παράλληλα επαγγελματικά project με την εργασία τους.
Η κίνηση αυτή έρχεται μετά την 35% αύξηση του 2023 και δείχνει ότι η SEGA ακολουθεί τη γενικότερη τάση των ιαπωνικών gaming εταιρειών όπως η Capcom και η FromSoftware, που επίσης επενδύουν περισσότερο στο ανθρώπινο δυναμικό τους.

Αφού η Rockstar Games δεν πρόκειται να φέρει (;) ποτέ ένα expansion για το Red Dead Redemption 2, θα το κάνουν οι fans. Μια κοινότητα από modders δημοσίευσαν το trailer για το Nuevo Paraíso - The Forgotten Frontier ένα fan made expansion για το παιχνίδι, το οποίο θα προσφέρει νέο περιεχόμενο.
Σύμφωνα με τους δημιουργούς, αυτό το DLC μεταφέρει τους παίκτες στο Μεξικό, με ολοκαίνουργιες αποστολές, νέα ζώα και περιοχές που έχουν γίνει remastered. Αν επιθυμείτε να παίξετε το DLC στο PC, τότε να σας πούμε ότι υπάρχει ήδη διαθέσιμο στο Nexus Mods σε early access μορφή. Το συγκεκριμένο project δεν είναι καινούργιο, ωστόσο, δουλεύεται ακόμα και αναμένεται να κυκλοφορήσει "ως κάτι μεγάλο".
Αυτή τη στιγμή, δεν έχει ολοκληρωθεί, οπότε για την πλήρη εμπειρία θα χρειαστεί να οπλιστείτε με υπομονή. Το συγκεκριμένο mod είναι διαθέσιμο μόνο στο PC. Μάλιστα, κατάφερε να γίνει αυτό που λέμε viral, καθώς έχει ήδη πάνω από 100.000 downloads και χιλιάδες προβολές -το βίντεο- σε όλα τα social media.
Η περιγραφή του expansion αναφέρει τα εξής:
Το Nuevo Paraíso - The Forgotten Frontier είναι μια μεγάλη επέκταση για το Red Dead Redemption 2. Είναι ένα φιλόδοξο recreation της μεξικανικής επικράτειας από το Red Dead Redemption 1, πλήρως ανανεωμένη και βελτιωμένη. Εξερευνήστε την ξεχασμένη πολιτεία του Nuevo Paraíso, επανασχεδιασμένη από την αρχή με μια απίστευτη λεπτομέρεια, διατηρώντας παράλληλα την αισθητική και των δύο Red Dead Redemption παιχνιδιών.
